many are the hours in which i have pondered upon the story that is setforth in the following pages. i trust that my instincts are not awrywhen they prompt me to leave the account, in simplicity, as it washanded to me.and the ms. itself--you must picture me, when first it was given into mycare, turning it over, curiously, and making a swift, jerky examination.a small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filledwith a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close. i have thequeer, faint, pit-water smell of it in my nostrils now as i write, andmy fingers have subconscious memories of the soft, "cloggy" feel of thelong-damp pages.i read, and, in reading, lifted the curtains of the impossible thatblind the mind, and looked out into the unknown. amid stiff, abruptsentences i wandered; and, presently, i had no fault to charge againsttheir abrupt tellings; for, better far than my own ambitious phrasing,is this mutilated story capable of bringing home all that the oldrecluse, of the vanished house, had striven to tell.of the simple, stiffly given account of weird and extraordinary matters,i will say little. it lies before you. the inner story must be uncovered,personally, by each reader, according to ability and desire. and evenshould any fail to see, as now i see, the shadowed picture and conceptionof that to which one may well give the accepted titles of heaven and hell;yet can i promise certain thrills, merely taking the story as a story.william hope hodgson december 17, 1907_i_the finding of the manuscriptright away in the west of ireland lies a tiny hamlet called kraighten.it is situated, alone, at the base of a low hill. far around therespreads a waste of bleak and totally inhospitable country; where, hereand there at great intervals, one may come upon the ruins of some longdesolate cottage--unthatched and stark. the whole land is bare andunpeopled, the very earth scarcely covering the rock that lies beneathit, and with which the country abounds, in places rising out of the soilin wave-shaped ridges.yet, in spite of its desolation, my friend tonnison and i had elected tospend our vacation there. he had stumbled on the place by mere chancethe year previously, during the course of a long walking tour, anddiscovered the possibilities for the angler in a small and unnamed riverthat runs past the outskirts of the little village.i have said that the river is without name; i may add that no map that ihave hitherto consulted has shown either village or stream. they seemto have entirely escaped observation: indeed, they might never exist forall that the average guide tells one. possibly this can be partlyaccounted for by the fact that the nearest railway station (ardrahan) issome forty miles distant.it was early one warm evening when my friend and i arrived in kraighten.we had reached ardrahan the previous night, sleeping there in roomshired at the village post office, and leaving in good time on thefollowing morning, clinging insecurely to one of the typicaljaunting cars.it had taken us all day to accomplish our journey over some of theroughest tracks imaginable, with the result that we were thoroughlytired and somewhat bad tempered. however, the tent had to be erected andour goods stowed away before we could think of food or rest. and so weset to work, with the aid of our driver, and soon had the tent up upon asmall patch of ground just outside the little village, and quite near tothe river.then, having stored all our belongings, we dismissed the driver, as hehad to make his way back as speedily as possible, and told him to comeacross to us at the end of a fortnight. we had brought sufficientprovisions to last us for that space of time, and water we could getfrom the stream. fuel we did not need, as we had included a smalloil-stove among our outfit, and the weather was fine and warm.it was tonnison's idea to camp out instead of getting lodgings in one ofthe cottages. as he put it, there was no joke in sleeping in a room witha numerous family of healthy irish in one corner and the pigsty in theother, while overhead a ragged colony of roosting fowls distributedtheir blessings impartially, and the whole place so full of peat smokethat it made a fellow sneeze his head off just to put it insidethe doorway.tonnison had got the stove lit now and was busy cutting slices of baconinto the frying pan; so i took the kettle and walked down to the riverfor water. on the way, i had to pass close to a little group of thevillage people, who eyed me curiously, but not in any unfriendly manner,though none of them ventured a word.as i returned with my kettle filled, i went up to them and, after afriendly nod, to which they replied in like manner, i asked themcasually about the fishing; but, instead of answering, they just shooktheir heads silently, and stared at me. i repeated the question,addressing more particularly a great, gaunt fellow at my elbow; yetagain i received no answer. then the man turned to a comrade and saidsomething rapidly in a language that i did not understand; and, at once,the whole crowd of them fell to jabbering in what, after a few moments,i guessed to be pure irish. at the same time they cast many glances inmy direction. for a minute, perhaps, they spoke among themselves thus;then the man i had addressed faced 'round at me and said something. bythe expression of his face i guessed that he, in turn, was questioningme; but now i had to shake my head, and indicate that i did notcomprehend what it was they wanted to know; and so we stood looking atone another, until i heard tonnison calling to me to hurry up with thekettle. then, with a smile and a nod, i left them, and all in the littlecrowd smiled and nodded in return, though their faces still betrayedtheir puzzlement.it was evident, i reflected as i went toward the tent, that theinhabitants of these few huts in the wilderness did not know a word ofenglish; and when i told tonnison, he remarked that he was aware of thefact, and, more, that it was not at all uncommon in that part of thecountry, where the people often lived and died in their isolated hamletswithout ever coming in contact with the outside world."i wish we had got the driver to interpret for us before he left," iremarked, as we sat down to our meal. "it seems so strange for thepeople of this place not even to know what we've come for."tonnison grunted an assent, and thereafter was silent for a while.later, having satisfied our appetites somewhat, we began to talk, layingour plans for the morrow; then, after a smoke, we closed the flap of thetent, and prepared to turn in."i suppose there's no chance of those fellows outside taking anything?"i asked, as we rolled ourselves in our blankets.tonnison said that he did not think so, at least while we were about;and, as he went on to explain, we could lock up everything, except thetent, in the big chest that we had brought to hold our provisions. iagreed to this, and soon we were both asleep.next morning, early, we rose and went for a swim in the river; afterwhich we dressed and had breakfast. then we roused out our fishingtackle and overhauled it, by which time, our breakfasts having settledsomewhat, we made all secure within the tent and strode off in thedirection my friend had explored on his previous visit.during the day we fished happily, working steadily upstream, and byevening we had one of the prettiest creels of fish that i had seen for along while. returning to the village, we made a good feed off our day'sspoil, after which, having selected a few of the finer fish for ourbreakfast, we presented the remainder to the group of villagers who hadassembled at a respectful distance to watch our doings. they seemedwonderfully grateful, and heaped mountains of what i presumed to beirish blessings upon our heads.thus we spent several days, having splendid sport, and first-rateappetites to do justice upon our prey. we were pleased to find howfriendly the villagers were inclined to be, and that there was noevidence of their having ventured to meddle with our belongings duringour absences.it was on a tuesday that we arrived in kraighten, and it would be on thesunday following that we made a great discovery. hitherto we had alwaysgone up-stream; on that day, however, we laid aside our rods, and,taking some provisions, set off for a long ramble in the oppositedirection. the day was warm, and we trudged along leisurely enough,stopping about mid-day to eat our lunch upon a great flat rock near theriverbank. afterward we sat and smoked awhile, resuming our walk onlywhen we were tired of inaction.for perhaps another hour we wandered onward, chatting quietly andcomfortably on this and that matter, and on several occasions stoppingwhile my companion--who is something of an artist--made rough sketchesof striking bits of the wild scenery.and then, without any warning whatsoever, the river we had followed soconfidently, came to an abrupt end--vanishing into the earth."good lord!" i said, "who ever would have thought of this?"and i stared in amazement; then i turned to tonnison. he was looking,with a blank expression upon his face, at the place where the riverdisappeared.in a moment he spoke."let us go on a bit; it may reappear again--anyhow, it is worthinvestigating."i agreed, and we went forward once more, though rather aimlessly; for wewere not at all certain in which direction to prosecute our search. forperhaps a mile we moved onward; then tonnison, who had been gazing aboutcuriously, stopped and shaded his eyes."see!" he said, after a moment, "isn't that mist or something, overthere to the right--away in a line with that great piece of rock?" andhe indicated with his hand.i stared, and, after a minute, seemed to see something, but could not becertain, and said so."anyway," my friend replied, "we'll just go across and have a glance."and he started off in the direction he had suggested, i following.presently, we came among bushes, and, after a time, out upon the top ofa high, boulder-strewn bank, from which we looked down into a wildernessof bushes and trees."seems as though we had come upon an oasis in this desert of stone,"muttered tonnison, as he gazed interestedly. then he was silent, hiseyes fixed; and i looked also; for up from somewhere about the center ofthe wooded lowland there rose high into the quiet air a great column ofhazelike spray, upon which the sun shone, causing innumerable rainbows."how beautiful!" i exclaimed."yes," answered tonnison, thoughtfully. "there must be a waterfall, orsomething, over there. perhaps it's our river come to light again. let'sgo and see."down the sloping bank we made our way, and entered among the trees andshrubberies. the bushes were matted, and the trees overhung us, so thatthe place was disagreeably gloomy; though not dark enough to hide fromme the fact that many of the trees were fruit trees, and that, here andthere, one could trace indistinctly, signs of a long departedcultivation. thus it came to me that we were making our way through theriot of a great and ancient garden. i said as much to tonnison, and heagreed that there certainly seemed reasonable grounds for my belief.what a wild place it was, so dismal and somber! somehow, as we wentforward, a sense of the silent loneliness and desertion of the oldgarden grew upon me, and i felt shivery. one could imagine thingslurking among the tangled bushes; while, in the very air of the place,there seemed something uncanny. i think tonnison was conscious of thisalso, though he said nothing.suddenly, we came to a halt. through the trees there had grown upon ourears a distant sound. tonnison bent forward, listening. i could hear itmore plainly now; it was continuous and harsh--a sort of droning roar,seeming to come from far away. i experienced a queer, indescribable,little feeling of nervousness. what sort of place was it into which wehad got? i looked at my companion, to see what he thought of the matter;and noted that there was only puzzlement in his face; and then, as iwatched his features, an expression of comprehension crept over them,and he nodded his head."that's a waterfall," he exclaimed, with conviction. "i know the soundnow." and he began to push vigorously through the bushes, in thedirection of the noise.as we went forward, the sound became plainer continually, showing thatwe were heading straight toward it. steadily, the roaring grew louderand nearer, until it appeared, as i remarked to tonnison, almost to comefrom under our feet--and still we were surrounded by the treesand shrubs."take care!" tonnison called to me. "look where you're going." and then,suddenly, we came out from among the trees, on to a great open space,where, not six paces in front of us, yawned the mouth of a tremendouschasm, from the depths of which the noise appeared to rise, along withthe continuous, mistlike spray that we had witnessed from the top of thedistant bank.for quite a minute we stood in silence, staring in bewilderment at thesight; then my friend went forward cautiously to the edge of the abyss.i followed, and, together, we looked down through a boil of spray at amonster cataract of frothing water that burst, spouting, from the sideof the chasm, nearly a hundred feet below."good lord!" said tonnison.i was silent, and rather awed. the sight was so unexpectedly grand andeerie; though this latter quality came more upon me later.presently, i looked up and across to the further side of the chasm.there, i saw something towering up among the spray: it looked like afragment of a great ruin, and i touched tonnison on the shoulder. heglanced 'round, with a start, and i pointed toward the thing. his gazefollowed my finger, and his eyes lighted up with a sudden flash ofexcitement, as the object came within his field of view."come along," he shouted above the uproar. "we'll have a look at it.there's something queer about this place; i feel it in my bones." and hestarted off, 'round the edge of the craterlike abyss. as we neared thisnew thing, i saw that i had not been mistaken in my first impression. itwas undoubtedly a portion of some ruined building; yet now i made outthat it was not built upon the edge of the chasm itself, as i had atfirst supposed; but perched almost at the extreme end of a huge spur ofrock that jutted out some fifty or sixty feet over the abyss. in fact,the jagged mass of ruin was literally suspended in midair.arriving opposite it, we walked out on to the projecting arm of rock,and i must confess to having felt an intolerable sense of terror as ilooked down from that dizzy perch into the unknown depths below us--intothe deeps from which there rose ever the thunder of the falling waterand the shroud of rising spray.reaching the ruin, we clambered 'round it cautiously, and, on thefurther side, came upon a mass of fallen stones and rubble. the ruinitself seemed to me, as i proceeded now to examine it minutely, to be aportion of the outer wall of some prodigious structure, it was so thickand substantially built; yet what it was doing in such a position icould by no means conjecture. where was the rest of the house, orcastle, or whatever there had been?i went back to the outer side of the wall, and thence to the edge of thechasm, leaving tonnison rooting systematically among the heap of stonesand rubbish on the outer side. then i commenced to examine the surfaceof the ground, near the edge of the abyss, to see whether there were notleft other remnants of the building to which the fragment of ruinevidently belonged. but though i scrutinized the earth with the greatestcare, i could see no signs of anything to show that there had ever beena building erected on the spot, and i grew more puzzled than ever.then, i heard a cry from tonnison; he was shouting my name, excitedly,and without delay i hurried along the rocky promontory to the ruin. iwondered whether he had hurt himself, and then the thought came, thatperhaps he had found something.i reached the crumbled wall and climbed 'round. there i found tonnisonstanding within a small excavation that he had made among the _debris_:he was brushing the dirt from something that looked like a book, muchcrumpled and dilapidated; and opening his mouth, every second or two, tobellow my name. as soon as he saw that i had come, he handed his prizeto me, telling me to put it into my satchel so as to protect it from thedamp, while he continued his explorations. this i did, first, however,running the pages through my fingers, and noting that they were closelyfilled with neat, old-fashioned writing which was quite legible, save inone portion, where many of the pages were almost destroyed, beingmuddied and crumpled, as though the book had been doubled back at thatpart. this, i found out from tonnison, was actually as he had discoveredit, and the damage was due, probably, to the fall of masonry upon theopened part. curiously enough, the book was fairly dry, which iattributed to its having been so securely buried among the ruins.having put the volume away safely, i turned-to and gave tonnison a handwith his self-imposed task of excavating; yet, though we put in over anhour's hard work, turning over the whole of the upheaped stones andrubbish, we came upon nothing more than some fragments of broken wood,that might have been parts of a desk or table; and so we gave upsearching, and went back along the rock, once more to the safety ofthe land.the next thing we did was to make a complete tour of the tremendouschasm, which we were able to observe was in the form of an almostperfect circle, save for where the ruin-crowned spur of rock jutted out,spoiling its symmetry.the abyss was, as tonnison put it, like nothing so much as a giganticwell or pit going sheer down into the bowels of the earth.for some time longer, we continued to stare about us, and then, noticingthat there was a clear space away to the north of the chasm, we bent oursteps in that direction.here, distant from the mouth of the mighty pit by some hundreds ofyards, we came upon a great lake of silent water--silent, that is, savein one place where there was a continuous bubbling and gurgling.now, being away from the noise of the spouting cataract, we were able tohear one another speak, without having to shout at the tops of ourvoices, and i asked tonnison what he thought of the place--i told himthat i didn't like it, and that the sooner we were out of it the betteri should be pleased.he nodded in reply, and glanced at the woods behind furtively. i askedhim if he had seen or heard anything. he made no answer; but stoodsilent, as though listening, and i kept quiet also.suddenly, he spoke."hark!" he said, sharply. i looked at him, and then away among the treesand bushes, holding my breath involuntarily. a minute came and went instrained silence; yet i could hear nothing, and i turned to tonnison tosay as much; and then, even as i opened my lips to speak, there came astrange wailing noise out of the wood on our left.... it appeared tofloat through the trees, and there was a rustle of stirring leaves, andthen silence.all at once, tonnison spoke, and put his hand on my shoulder. "let usget out of here," he said, and began to move slowly toward where thesurrounding trees and bushes seemed thinnest. as i followed him, it cameto me suddenly that the sun was low, and that there was a raw sense ofchilliness in the air.tonnison said nothing further, but kept on steadily. we were among thetrees now, and i glanced around, nervously; but saw nothing, save thequiet branches and trunks and the tangled bushes. onward we went, and nosound broke the silence, except the occasional snapping of a twig underour feet, as we moved forward. yet, in spite of the quietness, i had ahorrible feeling that we were not alone; and i kept so close to tonnisonthat twice i kicked his heels clumsily, though he said nothing. aminute, and then another, and we reached the confines of the wood comingout at last upon the bare rockiness of the countryside. only then was iable to shake off the haunting dread that had followed me amongthe trees.once, as we moved away, there seemed to come again a distant sound ofwailing, and i said to myself that it was the wind--yet the evening wasbreathless.presently, tonnison began to talk."look you," he said with decision, "i would not spend the night in_that_ place for all the wealth that the world holds. there is somethingunholy--diabolical--about it. it came to me all in a moment, just afteryou spoke. it seemed to me that the woods were full of vilethings--you know!""yes," i answered, and looked back toward the place; but it was hiddenfrom us by a rise in the ground."there's the book," i said, and i put my hand into the satchel."you've got it safely?" he questioned, with a sudden access of anxiety."yes," i replied."perhaps," he continued, "we shall learn something from it when we getback to the tent. we had better hurry, too; we're a long way off still,and i don't fancy, now, being caught out here in the dark."it was two hours later when we reached the tent; and, without delay, weset to work to prepare a meal; for we had eaten nothing since our lunchat midday.supper over, we cleared the things out of the way, and lit our pipes.then tonnison asked me to get the manuscript out of my satchel. this idid, and then, as we could not both read from it at the same time, hesuggested that i should read the thing out loud. "and mind," hecautioned, knowing my propensities, "don't go skipping half the book."yet, had he but known what it contained, he would have realized howneedless such advice was, for once at least. and there seated in theopening of our little tent, i began the strange tale of _the house onthe borderland_ (for such was the title of the ms.); this is told in thefollowing pages._ii_the plain of silencei am an old man. i live here in this ancient house, surrounded by huge,unkempt gardens.the peasantry, who inhabit the wilderness beyond, say that i am mad.that is because i will have nothing to do with them. i live here alonewith my old sister, who is also my housekeeper. we keep no servants--ihate them. i have one friend, a dog; yes, i would sooner have old pepperthan the rest of creation together. he, at least, understands me--andhas sense enough to leave me alone when i am in my dark moods.i have decided to start a kind of diary; it may enable me to recordsome of the thoughts and feelings that i cannot express to anyone; but,beyond this, i am anxious to make some record of the strange things thati have heard and seen, during many years of loneliness, in this weirdold building.for a couple of centuries, this house has had a reputation, a bad one,and, until i bought it, for more than eighty years no one had livedhere; consequently, i got the old place at a ridiculously low figure.i am not superstitious; but i have ceased to deny that things happenin this old house--things that i cannot explain; and, therefore, i mustneeds ease my mind, by writing down an account of them, to the best ofmy ability; though, should this, my diary, ever be read when i am gone,the readers will but shake their heads, and be the more convinced thati was mad.this house, how ancient it is! though its age strikes one less,perhaps, than the quaintness of its structure, which is curious andfantastic to the last degree. little curved towers and pinnacles, withoutlines suggestive of leaping flames, predominate; while the body ofthe building is in the form of a circle.i have heard that there is an old story, told amongst the countrypeople, to the effect that the devil built the place. however, that isas may be. true or not, i neither know nor care, save as it may havehelped to cheapen it, ere i came.i must have been here some ten years before i saw sufficient to warrantany belief in the stories, current in the neighborhood, about thishouse. it is true that i had, on at least a dozen occasions, seen,vaguely, things that puzzled me, and, perhaps, had felt more than i hadseen. then, as the years passed, bringing age upon me, i became oftenaware of something unseen, yet unmistakably present, in the empty roomsand corridors. still, it was as i have said many years before i saw anyreal manifestations of the so-called supernatural.it was not halloween. if i were telling a story for amusement's sake, ishould probably place it on that night of nights; but this is a truerecord of my own experiences, and i would not put pen to paper to amuseanyone. no. it was after midnight on the morning of the twenty-first dayof january. i was sitting reading, as is often my custom, in my study.pepper lay, sleeping, near my chair.without warning, the flames of the two candles went low, and thenshone with a ghastly green effulgence. i looked up, quickly, and as idid so i saw the lights sink into a dull, ruddy tint; so that the roomglowed with a strange, heavy, crimson twilight that gave the shadowsbehind the chairs and tables a double depth of blackness; and whereverthe light struck, it was as though luminous blood had been splashedover the room.down on the floor, i heard a faint, frightened whimper, and somethingpressed itself in between my two feet. it was pepper, cowering under mydressing gown. pepper, usually as brave as a lion!it was this movement of the dog's, i think, that gave me the firsttwinge of _real_ fear. i had been considerably startled when the lightsburnt first green and then red; but had been momentarily under theimpression that the change was due to some influx of noxious gas intothe room. now, however, i saw that it was not so; for the candles burnedwith a steady flame, and showed no signs of going out, as would havebeen the case had the change been due to fumes in the atmosphere.i did not move. i felt distinctly frightened; but could think ofnothing better to do than wait. for perhaps a minute, i kept my glanceabout the room, nervously. then i noticed that the lights had commencedto sink, very slowly; until presently they showed minute specks of redfire, like the gleamings of rubies in the darkness. still, i satwatching; while a sort of dreamy indifference seemed to steal over me;banishing altogether the fear that had begun to grip me.away in the far end of the huge old-fashioned room, i became consciousof a faint glow. steadily it grew, filling the room with gleams ofquivering green light; then they sank quickly, and changed--even as thecandle flames had done--into a deep, somber crimson that strengthened,and lit up the room with a flood of awful glory.the light came from the end wall, and grew ever brighter until itsintolerable glare caused my eyes acute pain, and involuntarily i closedthem. it may have been a few seconds before i was able to open them. thefirst thing i noticed was that the light had decreased, greatly; so thatit no longer tried my eyes. then, as it grew still duller, i was aware,all at once, that, instead of looking at the redness, i was staringthrough it, and through the wall beyond.gradually, as i became more accustomed to the idea, i realized that iwas looking out on to a vast plain, lit with the same gloomy twilightthat pervaded the room. the immensity of this plain scarcely can beconceived. in no part could i perceive its confines. it seemed tobroaden and spread out, so that the eye failed to perceive anylimitations. slowly, the details of the nearer portions began to growclear; then, in a moment almost, the light died away, and the vision--ifvision it were--faded and was gone.suddenly, i became conscious that i was no longer in the chair.instead, i seemed to be hovering above it, and looking down at a dimsomething, huddled and silent. in a little while, a cold blast struckme, and i was outside in the night, floating, like a bubble, up throughthe darkness. as i moved, an icy coldness seemed to enfold me, so thati shivered.after a time, i looked to right and left, and saw the intolerableblackness of the night, pierced by remote gleams of fire. onward,outward, i drove. once, i glanced behind, and saw the earth, a smallcrescent of blue light, receding away to my left. further off, the sun,a splash of white flame, burned vividly against the dark.an indefinite period passed. then, for the last time, i saw theearth--an enduring globule of radiant blue, swimming in an eternity ofether. and there i, a fragile flake of soul dust, flickered silentlyacross the void, from the distant blue, into the expanse of the unknown.a great while seemed to pass over me, and now i could nowhere seeanything. i had passed beyond the fixed stars and plunged into the hugeblackness that waits beyond. all this time i had experienced little,save a sense of lightness and cold discomfort. now however the atrociousdarkness seemed to creep into my soul, and i became filled with fear anddespair. what was going to become of me? where was i going? even as thethoughts were formed, there grew against the impalpable blackness thatwrapped me a faint tinge of blood. it seemed extraordinarily remote, andmistlike; yet, at once, the feeling of oppression was lightened, and ino longer despaired.slowly, the distant redness became plainer and larger; until, as i drewnearer, it spread out into a great, somber glare--dull and tremendous.still, i fled onward, and, presently, i had come so close, that itseemed to stretch beneath me, like a great ocean of somber red. i couldsee little, save that it appeared to spread out interminably in alldirections.in a further space, i found that i was descending upon it; and, soon, isank into a great sea of sullen, red-hued clouds. slowly, i emerged fromthese, and there, below me, i saw the stupendous plain that i had seenfrom my room in this house that stands upon the borders of the silences.presently, i landed, and stood, surrounded by a great waste ofloneliness. the place was lit with a gloomy twilight that gave animpression of indescribable desolation.afar to my right, within the sky, there burnt a gigantic ring ofdull-red fire, from the outer edge of which were projected huge,writhing flames, darted and jagged. the interior of this ring wasblack, black as the gloom of the outer night. i comprehended, at once,that it was from this extraordinary sun that the place derived itsdoleful light.from that strange source of light, i glanced down again to mysurroundings. everywhere i looked, i saw nothing but the same flatweariness of interminable plain. nowhere could i descry any signs oflife; not even the ruins of some ancient habitation.gradually, i found that i was being borne forward, floating across theflat waste. for what seemed an eternity, i moved onward. i was unawareof any great sense of impatience; though some curiosity and a vastwonder were with me continually. always, i saw around me the breadth ofthat enormous plain; and, always, i searched for some new thing to breakits monotony; but there was no change--only loneliness, silence,and desert.presently, in a half-conscious manner, i noticed that there was a faintmistiness, ruddy in hue, lying over its surface. still, when i lookedmore intently, i was unable to say that it was really mist; for itappeared to blend with the plain, giving it a peculiar unrealness, andconveying to the senses the idea of unsubstantiality.gradually, i began to weary with the sameness of the thing. yet, it wasa great time before i perceived any signs of the place, toward which iwas being conveyed."at first, i saw it, far ahead, like a long hillock on the surface ofthe plain. then, as i drew nearer, i perceived that i had been mistaken;for, instead of a low hill, i made out, now, a chain of great mountains,whose distant peaks towered up into the red gloom, until they werealmost lost to sight."_iii_the house in the arenaand so, after a time, i came to the mountains. then, the course of myjourney was altered, and i began to move along their bases, until, allat once, i saw that i had come opposite to a vast rift, opening into themountains. through this, i was borne, moving at no great speed. oneither side of me, huge, scarped walls of rocklike substance rose sheer.far overhead, i discerned a thin ribbon of red, where the mouth of thechasm opened, among inaccessible peaks. within, was gloom, deep andsomber, and chilly silence. for a while, i went onward steadily, andthen, at last, i saw, ahead, a deep, red glow, that told me i was nearupon the further opening of the gorge.a minute came and went, and i was at the exit of the chasm, staring outupon an enormous amphitheatre of mountains. yet, of the mountains, andthe terrible grandeur of the place, i recked nothing; for i wasconfounded with amazement to behold, at a distance of several miles andoccupying the center of the arena, a stupendous structure builtapparently of green jade. yet, in itself, it was not the discovery ofthe building that had so astonished me; but the fact, which became everymoment more apparent, that in no particular, save in color and itsenormous size, did the lonely structure vary from this house in whichi live.for a while, i continued to stare, fixedly. even then, i could scarcelybelieve that i saw aright. in my mind, a question formed, reiteratingincessantly: 'what does it mean?' 'what does it mean?' and i was unableto make answer, even out of the depths of my imagination. i seemedcapable only of wonder and fear. for a time longer, i gazed, notingcontinually some fresh point of resemblance that attracted me. at last,wearied and sorely puzzled, i turned from it, to view the rest of thestrange place on to which i had intruded.hitherto, i had been so engrossed in my scrutiny of the house, that ihad given only a cursory glance 'round. now, as i looked, i began torealize upon what sort of a place i had come. the arena, for so i havetermed it, appeared a perfect circle of about ten to twelve miles indiameter, the house, as i have mentioned before, standing in the center.the surface of the place, like to that of the plain, had a peculiar,misty appearance, that was yet not mist.from a rapid survey, my glance passed quickly upward along the <dw72>sof the circling mountains. how silent they were. i think that this sameabominable stillness was more trying to me than anything that i had sofar seen or imagined. i was looking up, now, at the great crags,towering so loftily. up there, the impalpable redness gave a blurredappearance to everything.and then, as i peered, curiously, a new terror came to me; for away upamong the dim peaks to my right, i had descried a vast shape ofblackness, giantlike. it grew upon my sight. it had an enormous equinehead, with gigantic ears, and seemed to peer steadfastly down into thearena. there was that about the pose that gave me the impression of aneternal watchfulness--of having warded that dismal place, throughunknown eternities. slowly, the monster became plainer to me; and then,suddenly, my gaze sprang from it to something further off and higheramong the crags. for a long minute, i gazed, fearfully. i was strangelyconscious of something not altogether unfamiliar--as though somethingstirred in the back of my mind. the thing was black, and had fourgrotesque arms. the features showed indistinctly, 'round the neck, imade out several light- objects. slowly, the details came to me,and i realized, coldly, that they were skulls. further down the body wasanother circling belt, showing less dark against the black trunk. then,even as i puzzled to know what the thing was, a memory slid into mymind, and straightway, i knew that i was looking at a monstrousrepresentation of kali, the hindu goddess of death.other remembrances of my old student days drifted into my thoughts. myglance fell back upon the huge beast-headed thing. simultaneously, irecognized it for the ancient egyptian god set, or seth, the destroyerof souls. with the knowledge, there came a great sweep ofquestioning--'two of the--!' i stopped, and endeavored to think. thingsbeyond my imagination peered into my frightened mind. i saw, obscurely.'the old gods of mythology!' i tried to comprehend to what it was allpointing. my gaze dwelt, flickeringly, between the two. 'if--'an idea came swiftly, and i turned, and glanced rapidly upward,searching the gloomy crags, away to my left. something loomed out undera great peak, a shape of greyness. i wondered i had not seen it earlier,and then remembered i had not yet viewed that portion. i saw it moreplainly now. it was, as i have said, grey. it had a tremendous head; butno eyes. that part of its face was blank.now, i saw that there were other things up among the mountains. furtheroff, reclining on a lofty ledge, i made out a livid mass, irregular andghoulish. it seemed without form, save for an unclean, half-animal face,that looked out, vilely, from somewhere about its middle. and then i sawothers--there were hundreds of them. they seemed to grow out of theshadows. several i recognized almost immediately as mythologicaldeities; others were strange to me, utterly strange, beyond the power ofa human mind to conceive.on each side, i looked, and saw more, continually. the mountains werefull of strange things--beast-gods, and horrors so atrocious and bestialthat possibility and decency deny any further attempt to describe them.and i--i was filled with a terrible sense of overwhelming horror andfear and repugnance; yet, spite of these, i wondered exceedingly. wasthere then, after all, something in the old heathen worship, somethingmore than the mere deifying of men, animals, and elements? the thoughtgripped me--was there?later, a question repeated itself. what were they, those beast-gods,and the others? at first, they had appeared to me just sculpturedmonsters placed indiscriminately among the inaccessible peaks andprecipices of the surrounding mountains. now, as i scrutinized them withgreater intentness, my mind began to reach out to fresh conclusions.there was something about them, an indescribable sort of silent vitalitythat suggested, to my broadening consciousness, a state oflife-in-death--a something that was by no means life, as we understandit; but rather an inhuman form of existence, that well might be likenedto a deathless trance--a condition in which it was possible to imaginetheir continuing, eternally. 'immortal!' the word rose in my thoughtsunbidden; and, straightway, i grew to wondering whether this might bethe immortality of the gods.and then, in the midst of my wondering and musing, something happened.until then, i had been staying just within the shadow of the exit of thegreat rift. now, without volition on my part, i drifted out of thesemi-darkness and began to move slowly across the arena--toward thehouse. at this, i gave up all thoughts of those prodigious shapes aboveme--and could only stare, frightenedly, at the tremendous structuretoward which i was being conveyed so remorselessly. yet, though isearched earnestly, i could discover nothing that i had not alreadyseen, and so became gradually calmer.presently, i had reached a point more than halfway between the houseand the gorge. all around was spread the stark loneliness of the place,and the unbroken silence. steadily, i neared the great building. then,all at once, something caught my vision, something that came 'round oneof the huge buttresses of the house, and so into full view. it was agigantic thing, and moved with a curious lope, going almost upright,after the manner of a man. it was quite unclothed, and had a remarkableluminous appearance. yet it was the face that attracted and frightenedme the most. it was the face of a swine.silently, intently, i watched this horrible creature, and forgot myfear, momentarily, in my interest in its movements. it was making itsway, cumbrously 'round the building, stopping as it came to each windowto peer in and shake at the bars, with which--as in this house--theywere protected; and whenever it came to a door, it would push at it,fingering the fastening stealthily. evidently, it was searching for aningress into the house.i had come now to within less than a quarter of a mile of the greatstructure, and still i was compelled forward. abruptly, the thing turnedand gazed hideously in my direction. it opened its mouth, and, for thefirst time, the stillness of that abominable place was broken, by adeep, booming note that sent an added thrill of apprehension through me.then, immediately, i became aware that it was coming toward me, swiftlyand silently. in an instant, it had covered half the distance that laybetween. and still, i was borne helplessly to meet it. only a hundredyards, and the brutish ferocity of the giant face numbed me with afeeling of unmitigated horror. i could have screamed, in the supremenessof my fear; and then, in the very moment of my extremity and despair, ibecame conscious that i was looking down upon the arena, from a rapidlyincreasing height. i was rising, rising. in an inconceivably shortwhile, i had reached an altitude of many hundred feet. beneath me, thespot that i had just left, was occupied by the foul swine-creature. ithad gone down on all fours and was snuffing and rooting, like averitable hog, at the surface of the arena. a moment and it rose to itsfeet, clutching upward, with an expression of desire upon its face suchas i have never seen in this world.continually, i mounted higher. a few minutes, it seemed, and i hadrisen above the great mountains--floating, alone, afar in the redness.at a tremendous distance below, the arena showed, dimly; with the mightyhouse looking no larger than a tiny spot of green. the swine-thing wasno longer visible.presently, i passed over the mountains, out above the huge breadth ofthe plain. far away, on its surface, in the direction of the ring-shapedsun, there showed a confused blur. i looked toward it, indifferently. itreminded me, somewhat, of the first glimpse i had caught of themountain-amphitheatre.with a sense of weariness, i glanced upward at the immense ring offire. what a strange thing it was! then, as i stared, out from the darkcenter, there spurted a sudden flare of extraordinary vivid fire.compared with the size of the black center, it was as naught; yet, initself, stupendous. with awakened interest, i watched it carefully,noting its strange boiling and glowing. then, in a moment, the wholething grew dim and unreal, and so passed out of sight. much amazed, iglanced down to the plain from which i was still rising. thus, ireceived a fresh surprise. the plain--everything had vanished, and onlya sea of red mist was spread far below me. gradually as i stared thisgrew remote, and died away into a dim far mystery of red against anunfathomable night. a while, and even this had gone, and i was wrappedin an impalpable, lightless gloom._iv_the earththus i was, and only the memory that i had lived through the dark, oncebefore, served to sustain my thoughts. a great time passed--ages. andthen a single star broke its way through the darkness. it was the firstof one of the outlying clusters of this universe. presently, it was farbehind, and all about me shone the splendor of the countless stars.later, years it seemed, i saw the sun, a clot of flame. around it, imade out presently several remote specks of light--the planets of thesolar system. and so i saw the earth again, blue and unbelievablyminute. it grew larger, and became defined.a long space of time came and went, and then at last i entered into theshadow of the world--plunging headlong into the dim and holy earthnight. overhead were the old constellations, and there was a crescentmoon. then, as i neared the earth's surface, a dimness swept over me,and i appeared to sink into a black mist.for a while, i knew nothing. i was unconscious. gradually, i becameaware of a faint, distant whining. it became plainer. a desperatefeeling of agony possessed me. i struggled madly for breath, and triedto shout. a moment, and i got my breath more easily. i was consciousthat something was licking my hand. something damp swept across my face.i heard a panting, and then again the whining. it seemed to come to myears, now, with a sense of familiarity, and i opened my eyes. all wasdark; but the feeling of oppression had left me. i was seated, andsomething was whining piteously, and licking me. i felt strangelyconfused, and, instinctively, tried to ward off the thing that licked.my head was curiously vacant, and, for the moment, i seemed incapable ofaction or thought. then, things came back to me, and i called 'pepper,'faintly. i was answered by a joyful bark, and renewed andfrantic caresses.in a little while, i felt stronger, and put out my hand for thematches. i groped about, for a few moments, blindly; then my hands litupon them, and i struck a light, and looked confusedly around. all aboutme, i saw the old, familiar things. and there i sat, full of dazedwonders, until the flame of the match burnt my finger, and i dropped it;while a hasty expression of pain and anger, escaped my lips, surprisingme with the sound of my own voice.after a moment, i struck another match, and, stumbling across the room,lit the candles. as i did so, i observed that they had not burned away,but had been put out.as the flames shot up, i turned, and stared about the study; yet therewas nothing unusual to see; and, suddenly, a gust of irritation took me.what had happened? i held my head, with both hands, and tried toremember. ah! the great, silent plain, and the ring-shaped sun of redfire. where were they? where had i seen them? how long ago? i felt dazedand muddled. once or twice, i walked up and down the room, unsteadily.my memory seemed dulled, and, already, the thing i had witnessed cameback to me with an effort.i have a remembrance of cursing, peevishly, in my bewilderment.suddenly, i turned faint and giddy, and had to grasp at the table forsupport. during a few moments, i held on, weakly; and then managed tototter sideways into a chair. after a little time, i felt somewhatbetter, and succeeded in reaching the cupboard where, usually, i keepbrandy and biscuits. i poured myself out a little of the stimulant, anddrank it off. then, taking a handful of biscuits, i returned to mychair, and began to devour them, ravenously. i was vaguely surprised atmy hunger. i felt as though i had eaten nothing for an uncountablylong while.as i ate, my glance roved about the room, taking in its variousdetails, and still searching, though almost unconsciously, for somethingtangible upon which to take hold, among the invisible mysteries thatencompassed me. 'surely,' i thought, 'there must be something--' and, inthe same instant, my gaze dwelt upon the face of the clock in theopposite corner. therewith, i stopped eating, and just stared. for,though its ticking indicated most certainly that it was still going, thehands were pointing to a little _before_ the hour of midnight; whereasit was, as well i knew, considerably _after_ that time when i hadwitnessed the first of the strange happenings i have just described.for perhaps a moment i was astounded and puzzled. had the hour been thesame as when i had last seen the clock, i should have concluded that thehands had stuck in one place, while the internal mechanism went on asusual; but that would, in no way, account for the hands having traveledbackward. then, even as i turned the matter over in my wearied brain,the thought flashed upon me that it was now close upon the morning ofthe twenty-second, and that i had been unconscious to the visible worldthrough the greater portion of the last twenty-four hours. the thoughtoccupied my attention for a full minute; then i commenced to eat again.i was still very hungry.during breakfast, next morning, i inquired casually of my sisterregarding the date, and found my surmise correct. i had, indeed, beenabsent--at least in spirit--for nearly a day and a night.my sister asked me no questions; for it is not by any means the firsttime that i have kept to my study for a whole day, and sometimes acouple of days at a time, when i have been particularly engrossed in mybooks or work.and so the days pass on, and i am still filled with a wonder to knowthe meaning of all that i saw on that memorable night. yet, well i knowthat my curiosity is little likely to be satisfied._v_the thing in the pitthis house is, as i have said before, surrounded by a huge estate, andwild and uncultivated gardens.away at the back, distant some three hundred yards, is a dark, deepravine--spoken of as the 'pit,' by the peasantry. at the bottom runs asluggish stream so overhung by trees as scarcely to be seen from above.in passing, i must explain that this river has a subterranean origin,emerging suddenly at the east end of the ravine, and disappearing, asabruptly, beneath the cliffs that form its western extremity.it was some months after my vision (if vision it were) of the greatplain that my attention was particularly attracted to the pit.i happened, one day, to be walking along its southern edge, when,suddenly, several pieces of rock and shale were dislodged from the faceof the cliff immediately beneath me, and fell with a sullen crashthrough the trees. i heard them splash in the river at the bottom; andthen silence. i should not have given this incident more than a passingthought, had not pepper at once begun to bark savagely; nor would he besilent when i bade him, which is most unusual behavior on his part.feeling that there must be someone or something in the pit, i went backto the house, quickly, for a stick. when i returned, pepper had ceasedhis barks and was growling and smelling, uneasily, along the top.whistling to him to follow me, i started to descend cautiously. thedepth to the bottom of the pit must be about a hundred and fifty feet,and some time as well as considerable care was expended before wereached the bottom in safety.once down, pepper and i started to explore along the banks of theriver. it was very dark there due to the overhanging trees, and i movedwarily, keeping my glance about me and my stick ready.pepper was quiet now and kept close to me all the time. thus, wesearched right up one side of the river, without hearing or seeinganything. then, we crossed over--by the simple method of jumping--andcommenced to beat our way back through the underbrush.we had accomplished perhaps half the distance, when i heard again thesound of falling stones on the other side--the side from which we hadjust come. one large rock came thundering down through the treetops,struck the opposite bank, and bounded into the river, driving a greatjet of water right over us. at this, pepper gave out a deep growl; thenstopped, and pricked up his ears. i listened, also.a second later, a loud, half-human, half-piglike squeal sounded fromamong the trees, apparently about halfway up the south cliff. it wasanswered by a similar note from the bottom of the pit. at this, peppergave a short, sharp bark, and, springing across the little river,disappeared into the bushes.immediately afterward, i heard his barks increase in depth and number,and in between there sounded a noise of confused jabbering. this ceased,and, in the succeeding silence, there rose a semi-human yell of agony.almost immediately, pepper gave a long-drawn howl of pain, and then theshrubs were violently agitated, and he came running out with his taildown, and glancing as he ran over his shoulder. as he reached me, i sawthat he was bleeding from what appeared to be a great claw wound in theside that had almost laid bare his ribs.seeing pepper thus mutilated, a furious feeling of anger seized me,and, whirling my staff, i sprang across, and into the bushes from whichpepper had emerged. as i forced my way through, i thought i heard asound of breathing. next instant, i had burst into a little clear space,just in time to see something, livid white in color, disappear among thebushes on the opposite side. with a shout, i ran toward it; but, thoughi struck and probed among the bushes with my stick, i neither saw norheard anything further; and so returned to pepper. there, after bathinghis wound in the river, i bound my wetted handkerchief 'round his body;having done which, we retreated up the ravine and into thedaylight again.on reaching the house, my sister inquired what had happened to pepper,and i told her he had been fighting with a wildcat, of which i had heardthere were several about.i felt it would be better not to tell her how it had really happened;though, to be sure, i scarcely knew myself; but this i did know, thatthe thing i had seen run into the bushes was no wildcat. it was much toobig, and had, so far as i had observed, a skin like a hog's, only of adead, unhealthy white color. and then--it had run upright, or nearly so,upon its hind feet, with a motion somewhat resembling that of a humanbeing. this much i had noticed in my brief glimpse, and, truth to tell,i felt a good deal of uneasiness, besides curiosity as i turned thematter over in my mind.it was in the morning that the above incident had occurred.then, it would be after dinner, as i sat reading, that, happening tolook up suddenly, i saw something peering in over the window ledge theeyes and ears alone showing.'a pig, by jove!' i said, and rose to my feet. thus, i saw the thingmore completely; but it was no pig--god alone knows what it was. itreminded me, vaguely, of the hideous thing that had haunted the greatarena. it had a grotesquely human mouth and jaw; but with no chin ofwhich to speak. the nose was prolonged into a snout; thus it was thatwith the little eyes and queer ears, gave it such an extraordinarilyswinelike appearance. of forehead there was little, and the whole facewas of an unwholesome white color.for perhaps a minute, i stood looking at the thing with an ever growingfeeling of disgust, and some fear. the mouth kept jabbering, inanely,and once emitted a half-swinish grunt. i think it was the eyes thatattracted me the most; they seemed to glow, at times, with a horriblyhuman intelligence, and kept flickering away from my face, over thedetails of the room, as though my stare disturbed it.it appeared to be supporting itself by two clawlike hands upon thewindowsill. these claws, unlike the face, were of a clayey brown hue,and bore an indistinct resemblance to human hands, in that they had fourfingers and a thumb; though these were webbed up to the first joint,much as are a duck's. nails it had also, but so long and powerful thatthey were more like the talons of an eagle than aught else.as i have said, before, i felt some fear; though almost of animpersonal kind. i may explain my feeling better by saying that it wasmore a sensation of abhorrence; such as one might expect to feel, ifbrought in contact with something superhumanly foul; somethingunholy--belonging to some hitherto undreamt of state of existence.i cannot say that i grasped these various details of the brute at thetime. i think they seemed to come back to me, afterward, as thoughimprinted upon my brain. i imagined more than i saw as i looked at thething, and the material details grew upon me later.for perhaps a minute i stared at the creature; then as my nervessteadied a little i shook off the vague alarm that held me, and took astep toward the window. even as i did so, the thing ducked and vanished.i rushed to the door and looked 'round hurriedly; but only the tangledbushes and shrubs met my gaze.i ran back into the house, and, getting my gun, sallied out to searchthrough the gardens. as i went, i asked myself whether the thing i hadjust seen was likely to be the same of which i had caught a glimpse inthe morning. i inclined to think it was.i would have taken pepper with me; but judged it better to give hiswound a chance to heal. besides, if the creature i had just seen was, asi imagined, his antagonist of the morning, it was not likely that hewould be of much use.i began my search, systematically. i was determined, if it werepossible, to find and put an end to that swine-thing. this was, atleast, a material horror!at first, i searched, cautiously; with the thought of pepper's wound inmy mind; but, as the hours passed, and not a sign of anything living,showed in the great, lonely gardens, i became less apprehensive. i feltalmost as though i would welcome the sight of it. anything seemed betterthan this silence, with the ever-present feeling that the creature mightbe lurking in every bush i passed. later, i grew careless of danger, tothe extent of plunging right through the bushes, probing with my gunbarrel as i went.at times, i shouted; but only the echoes answered back. i thought thusperhaps to frighten or stir the creature to showing itself; but onlysucceeded in bringing my sister mary out, to know what was the matter. itold her, that i had seen the wildcat that had wounded pepper, and thati was trying to hunt it out of the bushes. she seemed only halfsatisfied, and went back into the house, with an expression of doubtupon her face. i wondered whether she had seen or guessed anything. forthe rest of the afternoon, i prosecuted the search anxiously. i feltthat i should be unable to sleep, with that bestial thing haunting theshrubberies, and yet, when evening fell, i had seen nothing. then, as iturned homeward, i heard a short, unintelligible noise, among the bushesto my right. instantly, i turned, and, aiming quickly, fired in thedirection of the sound. immediately afterward, i heard somethingscuttling away among the bushes. it moved rapidly, and in a minute hadgone out of hearing. after a few steps i ceased my pursuit, realizinghow futile it must be in the fast gathering gloom; and so, with acurious feeling of depression, i entered the house.that night, after my sister had gone to bed, i went 'round to all thewindows and doors on the ground floor; and saw to it that they weresecurely fastened. this precaution was scarcely necessary as regards thewindows, as all of those on the lower storey are strongly barred; butwith the doors--of which there are five--it was wisely thought, as notone was locked.having secured these, i went to my study, yet, somehow, for once, theplace jarred upon me; it seemed so huge and echoey. for some time itried to read; but at last finding it impossible i carried my book downto the kitchen where a large fire was burning, and sat there.i dare say, i had read for a couple of hours, when, suddenly, i heard asound that made me lower my book, and listen, intently. it was a noiseof something rubbing and fumbling against the back door. once the doorcreaked, loudly; as though force were being applied to it. during thosefew, short moments, i experienced an indescribable feeling of terror,such as i should have believed impossible. my hands shook; a cold sweatbroke out on me, and i shivered violently.gradually, i calmed. the stealthy movements outside had ceased.then for an hour i sat silent and watchful. all at once the feeling offear took me again. i felt as i imagine an animal must, under the eye ofa snake. yet now i could hear nothing. still, there was no doubting thatsome unexplained influence was at work.gradually, imperceptibly almost, something stole on my ear--a soundthat resolved itself into a faint murmur. quickly it developed and grewinto a muffled but hideous chorus of bestial shrieks. it appeared torise from the bowels of the earth.i heard a thud, and realized in a dull, half comprehending way that ihad dropped my book. after that, i just sat; and thus the daylight foundme, when it crept wanly in through the barred, high windows of thegreat kitchen.with the dawning light, the feeling of stupor and fear left me; and icame more into possession of my senses.thereupon i picked up my book, and crept to the door to listen. not asound broke the chilly silence. for some minutes i stood there; then,very gradually and cautiously, i drew back the bolt and opening the doorpeeped out.my caution was unneeded. nothing was to be seen, save the grey vista ofdreary, tangled bushes and trees, extending to the distant plantation.with a shiver, i closed the door, and made my way, quietly, up to bed._vi_the swine-thingsit was evening, a week later. my sister sat in the garden, knitting. iwas walking up and down, reading. my gun leant up against the wall ofthe house; for, since the advent of that strange thing in the gardens, ihad deemed it wise to take precautions. yet, through the whole week,there had been nothing to alarm me, either by sight or sound; so that iwas able to look back, calmly, to the incident; though still with asense of unmitigated wonder and curiosity.i was, as i have just said, walking up and down, and somewhat engrossedin my book. suddenly, i heard a crash, away in the direction of the pit.with a quick movement, i turned and saw a tremendous column of dustrising high into the evening air.my sister had risen to her feet, with a sharp exclamation of surpriseand fright.telling her to stay where she was, i snatched up my gun, and ran towardthe pit. as i neared it, i heard a dull, rumbling sound, that grewquickly into a roar, split with deeper crashes, and up from the pitdrove a fresh volume of dust.the noise ceased, though the dust still rose, tumultuously.i reached the edge, and looked down; but could see nothing save a boilof dust clouds swirling hither and thither. the air was so full of thesmall particles, that they blinded and choked me; and, finally, i had torun out from the smother, to breathe.gradually, the suspended matter sank, and hung in a panoply over themouth of the pit.i could only guess at what had happened.that there had been a land-slip of some kind, i had little doubt; butthe cause was beyond my knowledge; and yet, even then, i had halfimaginings; for, already, the thought had come to me, of those fallingrocks, and that thing in the bottom of the pit; but, in the firstminutes of confusion, i failed to reach the natural conclusion, to whichthe catastrophe pointed.slowly, the dust subsided, until, presently, i was able to approach theedge, and look down.for a while, i peered impotently, trying to see through the reek. atfirst, it was impossible to make out anything. then, as i stared, i sawsomething below, to my left, that moved. i looked intently toward it,and, presently, made out another, and then another--three dim shapesthat appeared to be climbing up the side of the pit. i could see themonly indistinctly. even as i stared and wondered, i heard a rattle ofstones, somewhere to my right. i glanced across; but could see nothing.i leant forward, and peered over, and down into the pit, just beneathwhere i stood; and saw no further than a hideous, white swine-face, thathad risen to within a couple of yards of my feet. below it, i could makeout several others. as the thing saw me, it gave a sudden, uncouthsqueal, which was answered from all parts of the pit. at that, a gust ofhorror and fear took me, and, bending down, i discharged my gun rightinto its face. straightway, the creature disappeared, with a clatter ofloose earth and stones.there was a momentary silence, to which, probably, i owe my life; for,during it, i heard a quick patter of many feet, and, turning sharply,saw a troop of the creatures coming toward me, at a run. instantly, iraised my gun and fired at the foremost, who plunged head-long, with ahideous howling. then, i turned to run. more than halfway from the houseto the pit, i saw my sister--she was coming toward me. i could not seeher face, distinctly, as the dusk had fallen; but there was fear in hervoice as she called to know why i was shooting.'run!' i shouted in reply. 'run for your life!'without more ado, she turned and fled--picking up her skirts with bothhands. as i followed, i gave a glance behind. the brutes were running ontheir hind legs--at times dropping on all fours.i think it must have been the terror in my voice, that spurred mary torun so; for i feel convinced that she had not, as yet, seen those hellcreatures that pursued.on we went, my sister leading.each moment, the nearing sounds of the footsteps, told me that thebrutes were gaining on us, rapidly. fortunately, i am accustomed tolive, in some ways, an active life. as it was, the strain of the racewas beginning to tell severely upon me.ahead, i could see the back door--luckily it was open. i was somehalf-dozen yards behind mary, now, and my breath was sobbing in mythroat. then, something touched my shoulder. i wrenched my head 'round,quickly, and saw one of those monstrous, pallid faces close to mine. oneof the creatures, having outrun its companions, had almost overtaken me.even as i turned, it made a fresh grab. with a sudden effort, i sprangto one side, and, swinging my gun by the barrel, brought it crashingdown upon the foul creature's head. the thing dropped, with an almosthuman groan.even this short delay had been nearly sufficient to bring the rest ofthe brutes down upon me; so that, without an instant's waste of time, iturned and ran for the door.reaching it, i burst into the passage; then, turning quickly, slammedand bolted the door, just as the first of the creatures rushed againstit, with a sudden shock.my sister sat, gasping, in a chair. she seemed in a fainting condition;but i had no time then to spend on her. i had to make sure that all thedoors were fastened. fortunately, they were. the one leading from mystudy into the gardens, was the last to which i went. i had just hadtime to note that it was secured, when i thought i heard a noiseoutside. i stood perfectly silent, and listened. yes! now i coulddistinctly hear a sound of whispering, and something slithered over thepanels, with a rasping, scratchy noise. evidently, some of the bruteswere feeling with their claw-hands, about the door, to discover whetherthere were any means of ingress.that the creatures should so soon have found the door was--to me--aproof of their reasoning capabilities. it assured me that they must notbe regarded, by any means, as mere animals. i had felt something of thisbefore, when that first thing peered in through my window. then i hadapplied the term superhuman to it, with an almost instinctive knowledgethat the creature was something different from the brute-beast.something beyond human; yet in no good sense; but rather as somethingfoul and hostile to the _great_ and _good_ in humanity. in a word, assomething intelligent, and yet inhuman. the very thought of thecreatures filled me with revulsion.now, i bethought me of my sister, and, going to the cupboard, i gotout a flask of brandy, and a wine-glass. taking these, i went down tothe kitchen, carrying a lighted candle with me. she was not sitting inthe chair, but had fallen out, and was lying upon the floor,face downward.very gently, i turned her over, and raised her head somewhat. then, ipoured a little of the brandy between her lips. after a while, sheshivered slightly. a little later, she gave several gasps, and openedher eyes. in a dreamy, unrealizing way, she looked at me. then her eyesclosed, slowly, and i gave her a little more of the brandy. for, perhapsa minute longer, she lay silent, breathing quickly. all at once, hereyes opened again, and it seemed to me, as i looked, that the pupilswere dilated, as though fear had come with returning consciousness.then, with a movement so unexpected that i started backward, she sat up.noticing that she seemed giddy, i put out my hand to steady her. atthat, she gave a loud scream, and, scrambling to her feet, ran fromthe room.for a moment, i stayed there--kneeling and holding the brandy flask. iwas utterly puzzled and astonished.could she be afraid of me? but no! why should she? i could onlyconclude that her nerves were badly shaken, and that she was temporarilyunhinged. upstairs, i heard a door bang, loudly, and i knew that she hadtaken refuge in her room. i put the flask down on the table. myattention was distracted by a noise in the direction of the back door. iwent toward it, and listened. it appeared to be shaken, as though someof the creatures struggled with it, silently; but it was far toostrongly constructed and hung to be easily moved.out in the gardens rose a continuous sound. it might have beenmistaken, by a casual listener, for the grunting and squealing of a herdof pigs. but, as i stood there, it came to me that there was sense andmeaning to all those swinish noises. gradually, i seemed able to tracea semblance in it to human speech--glutinous and sticky, as though eacharticulation were made with difficulty: yet, nevertheless, i wasbecoming convinced that it was no mere medley of sounds; but a rapidinterchange of ideas.by this time, it had grown quite dark in the passages, and from thesecame all the varied cries and groans of which an old house is so fullafter nightfall. it is, no doubt, because things are then quieter, andone has more leisure to hear. also, there may be something in the theorythat the sudden change of temperature, at sundown, affects the structureof the house, somewhat--causing it to contract and settle, as it were,for the night. however, this is as may be; but, on that night inparticular, i would gladly have been quit of so many eerie noises. itseemed to me, that each crack and creak was the coming of one of thosethings along the dark corridors; though i knew in my heart that thiscould not be, for i had seen, myself, that all the doors were secure.gradually, however, these sounds grew on my nerves to such an extentthat, were it only to punish my cowardice, i felt i must make the 'roundof the basement again, and, if anything were there, face it. and then, iwould go up to my study, for i knew sleep was out of the question, withthe house surrounded by creatures, half beasts, half something else, andentirely unholy.taking the kitchen lamp down from its hook, i made my way from cellarto cellar, and room to room; through pantry and coal-hole--alongpassages, and into the hundred-and-one little blind alleys and hiddennooks that form the basement of the old house. then, when i knew i hadbeen in every corner and cranny large enough to conceal aught of anysize, i made my way to the stairs.with my foot on the first step, i paused. it seemed to me, i heard amovement, apparently from the buttery, which is to the left of thestaircase. it had been one of the first places i searched, and yet, ifelt certain my ears had not deceived me. my nerves were strung now,and, with hardly any hesitation, i stepped up to the door, holding thelamp above my head. in a glance, i saw that the place was empty, savefor the heavy, stone slabs, supported by brick pillars; and i was aboutto leave it, convinced that i had been mistaken; when, in turning, mylight was flashed back from two bright spots outside the window, andhigh up. for a few moments, i stood there, staring. then theymoved--revolving slowly, and throwing out alternate scintillations ofgreen and red; at least, so it appeared to me. i knew then that theywere eyes.slowly, i traced the shadowy outline of one of the things. it appearedto be holding on to the bars of the window, and its attitude suggestedclimbing. i went nearer to the window, and held the light higher. therewas no need to be afraid of the creature; the bars were strong, andthere was little danger of its being able to move them. and then,suddenly, in spite of the knowledge that the brute could not reach toharm me, i had a return of the horrible sensation of fear, that hadassailed me on that night, a week previously. it was the same feeling ofhelpless, shuddering fright. i realized, dimly, that the creature's eyeswere looking into mine with a steady, compelling stare. i tried to turnaway; but could not. i seemed, now, to see the window through a mist.then, i thought other eyes came and peered, and yet others; until awhole galaxy of malignant, staring orbs seemed to hold me in thrall.my head began to swim, and throb violently. then, i was aware of afeeling of acute physical pain in my left hand. it grew more severe, andforced, literally forced, my attention. with a tremendous effort, iglanced down; and, with that, the spell that had held me was broken. irealized, then, that i had, in my agitation, unconsciously caught holdof the hot lamp-glass, and burnt my hand, badly. i looked up to thewindow, again. the misty appearance had gone, and, now, i saw that itwas crowded with dozens of bestial faces. with a sudden access of rage,i raised the lamp, and hurled it, full at the window. it struck theglass (smashing a pane), and passed between two of the bars, out intothe garden, scattering burning oil as it went. i heard several loudcries of pain, and, as my sight became accustomed to the dark, idiscovered that the creatures had left the window.pulling myself together, i groped for the door, and, having found it,made my way upstairs, stumbling at each step. i felt dazed, as though ihad received a blow on the head. at the same time, my hand smartedbadly, and i was full of a nervous, dull rage against those things.reaching my study, i lit the candles. as they burnt up, their rays werereflected from the rack of firearms on the sidewall. at the sight, iremembered that i had there a power, which, as i had proved earlier,seemed as fatal to those monsters as to more ordinary animals; and idetermined i would take the offensive.first of all, i bound up my hand; for the pain was fast becomingintolerable. after that, it seemed easier, and i crossed the room, tothe rifle stand. there, i selected a heavy rifle--an old and triedweapon; and, having procured ammunition, i made my way up into one ofthe small towers, with which the house is crowned.from there, i found that i could see nothing. the gardens presented adim blur of shadows--a little blacker, perhaps, where the trees stood.that was all, and i knew that it was useless to shoot down into all thatdarkness. the only thing to be done, was to wait for the moon to rise;then, i might be able to do a little execution.in the meantime, i sat still, and kept my ears open. the gardens werecomparatively quiet now, and only an occasional grunt or squeal came upto me. i did not like this silence; it made me wonder on what devilrythe creatures were bent. twice, i left the tower, and took a walkthrough the house; but everything was silent.once, i heard a noise, from the direction of the pit, as though moreearth had fallen. following this, and lasting for some fifteen minutes,there was a commotion among the denizens of the gardens. this died away,and, after that all was again quiet.about an hour later, the moon's light showed above the distant horizon.from where i sat, i could see it over the trees; but it was not until itrose clear of them, that i could make out any of the details in thegardens below. even then, i could see none of the brutes; until,happening to crane forward, i saw several of them lying prone, upagainst the wall of the house. what they were doing, i could not makeout. it was, however, a chance too good to be ignored; and, taking aim,i fired at the one directly beneath. there was a shrill scream, and, asthe smoke cleared away, i saw that it had turned on its back, and waswrithing, feebly. then, it was quiet. the others had disappeared.immediately after this, i heard a loud squeal, in the direction of thepit. it was answered, a hundred times, from every part of the garden.this gave me some notion of the number of the creatures, and i began tofeel that the whole affair was becoming even more serious than ihad imagined.as i sat there, silent and watchful, the thought came to me--why wasall this? what were these things? what did it mean? then my thoughtsflew back to that vision (though, even now, i doubt whether it was avision) of the plain of silence. what did that mean? i wondered--andthat thing in the arena? ugh! lastly, i thought of the house i had seenin that far-away place. that house, so like this in every detail ofexternal structure, that it might have been modeled from it; or thisfrom that. i had never thought of that--at this moment, there came another long squeal, from the pit, followed,a second later, by a couple of shorter ones. at once, the garden wasfilled with answering cries. i stood up, quickly, and looked over theparapet. in the moonlight, it seemed as though the shrubberies werealive. they tossed hither and thither, as though shaken by a strong,irregular wind; while a continuous rustling, and a noise of scamperingfeet, rose up to me. several times, i saw the moonlight gleam onrunning, white figures among the bushes, and, twice, i fired. the secondtime, my shot was answered by a short squeal of pain.a minute later, the gardens lay silent. from the pit, came a deep,hoarse babel of swine-talk. at times, angry cries smote the air, andthey would be answered by multitudinous gruntings. it occurred to me,that they were holding some kind of a council, perhaps to discuss theproblem of entering the house. also, i thought that they seemed muchenraged, probably by my successful shots.it occurred to me, that now would be a good time to make a final surveyof our defenses. this, i proceeded to do at once; visiting the whole ofthe basement again, and examining each of the doors. luckily, they areall, like the back one, built of solid, iron-studded oak. then, i wentupstairs to the study. i was more anxious about this door. it is,palpably, of a more modern make than the others, and, though a stoutpiece of work, it has little of their ponderous strength.i must explain here, that there is a small, raised lawn on this side ofthe house, upon which this door opens--the windows of the study beingbarred on this account. all the other entrances--excepting the greatgateway which is never opened--are in the lower storey._vii_the attacki spent some time, puzzling how to strengthen the study door. finally,i went down to the kitchen, and with some trouble, brought up severalheavy pieces of timber. these, i wedged up, slantwise, against it, fromthe floor, nailing them top and bottom. for half-an-hour, i worked hard,and, at last, got it shored to my mind.then, feeling easier, i resumed my coat, which i had laid aside, andproceeded to attend to one or two matters before returning to the tower.it was whilst thus employed, that i heard a fumbling at the door, andthe latch was tried. keeping silence, i waited. soon, i heard several ofthe creatures outside. they were grunting to one another, softly. then,for a minute, there was quietness. suddenly, there sounded a quick, lowgrunt, and the door creaked under a tremendous pressure. it would haveburst inward; but for the supports i had placed. the strain ceased, asquickly as it had begun, and there was more talk.presently, one of the things squealed, softly, and i heard the soundof others approaching. there was a short confabulation; then again,silence; and i realized that they had called several more to assist.feeling that now was the supreme moment, i stood ready, with my riflepresented. if the door gave, i would, at least, slay as manyas possible.again came the low signal; and, once more, the door cracked, under ahuge force. for, a minute perhaps, the pressure was kept up; and iwaited, nervously; expecting each moment to see the door come down witha crash. but no; the struts held, and the attempt proved abortive. thenfollowed more of their horrible, grunting talk, and, whilst it lasted, ithought i distinguished the noise of fresh arrivals.after a long discussion, during which the door was several timesshaken, they became quiet once more, and i knew that they were going tomake a third attempt to break it down. i was almost in despair. theprops had been severely tried in the two previous attacks, and i wassorely afraid that this would prove too much for them.at that moment, like an inspiration, a thought flashed into my troubledbrain. instantly, for it was no time to hesitate, i ran from the room,and up stair after stair. this time, it was not to one of the towers,that i went; but out on to the flat, leaded roof itself. once there, iraced across to the parapet, that walls it 'round, and looked down. as idid so, i heard the short, grunted signal, and, even up there, caughtthe crying of the door under the assault.there was not a moment to lose, and, leaning over, i aimed, quickly,and fired. the report rang sharply, and, almost blending with it, camethe loud splud of the bullet striking its mark. from below, rose ashrill wail; and the door ceased its groaning. then, as i took my weightfrom off the parapet, a huge piece of the stone coping slid from underme, and fell with a crash among the disorganized throng beneath.several horrible shrieks quavered through the night air, and then iheard a sound of scampering feet. cautiously, i looked over. in themoonlight, i could see the great copingstone, lying right across thethreshold of the door. i thought i saw something under it--severalthings, white; but i could not be sure.and so a few minutes passed.as i stared, i saw something come 'round, out of the shadow of thehouse. it was one of the things. it went up to the stone, silently, andbent down. i was unable to see what it did. in a minute it stood up. ithad something in its talons, which it put to its mouth and tore at....for the moment, i did not realize. then, slowly, i comprehended. thething was stooping again. it was horrible. i started to load my rifle.when i looked again, the monster was tugging at the stone--moving it toone side. i leant the rifle on the coping, and pulled the trigger. thebrute collapsed, on its face, and kicked, slightly.simultaneously, almost, with the report, i heard another sound--that ofbreaking glass. waiting, only to recharge my weapon, i ran from theroof, and down the first two flights of stairs.here, i paused to listen. as i did so, there came another tinkle offalling glass. it appeared to come from the floor below. excitedly, isprang down the steps, and, guided by the rattle of the window-sash,reached the door of one of the empty bedrooms, at the back of the house.i thrust it open. the room was but dimly illuminated by the moonlight;most of the light being blotted out by moving figures at the window.even as i stood, one crawled through, into the room. leveling my weapon,i fired point-blank at it--filling the room with a deafening bang. whenthe smoke cleared, i saw that the room was empty, and the window free.the room was much lighter. the night air blew in, coldly, through theshattered panes. down below, in the night, i could hear a soft moaning,and a confused murmur of swine-voices.stepping to one side of the window, i reloaded, and then stood there,waiting. presently, i heard a scuffling noise. from where i stood in theshadow, i could see, without being seen.nearer came the sounds, and then i saw something come up above thesill, and clutch at the broken window-frame. it caught a piece of thewoodwork; and, now, i could make out that it was a hand and arm. amoment later, the face of one of the swine-creatures rose into view.then, before i could use my rifle, or do anything, there came a sharpcrack--cr-ac-k; and the window-frame gave way under the weight of thething. next instant, a squashing thud, and a loud outcry, told me thatit had fallen to the ground. with a savage hope that it had been killed,i went to the window. the moon had gone behind a cloud, so that i couldsee nothing; though a steady hum of jabbering, just beneath where istood, indicated that there were several more of the brutes closeat hand.as i stood there, looking down, i marveled how it had been possible forthe creatures to climb so far; for the wall is comparatively smooth,while the distance to the ground must be, at least, eighty feet.all at once, as i bent, peering, i saw something, indistinctly, thatcut the grey shadow of the house-side, with a black line. it passed thewindow, to the left, at a distance of about two feet. then, i rememberedthat it was a gutter-pipe, that had been put there some years ago, tocarry off the rainwater. i had forgotten about it. i could see, now, howthe creatures had managed to reach the window. even as the solution cameto me, i heard a faint slithering, scratching noise, and knew thatanother of the brutes was coming. i waited some odd moments; then leantout of the window and felt the pipe. to my delight, i found that it wasquite loose, and i managed, using the rifle-barrel as a crowbar, tolever it out from the wall. i worked quickly. then, taking hold withboth bands, i wrenched the whole concern away, and hurled it down--withthe thing still clinging to it--into the garden.for a few minutes longer, i waited there, listening; but, after thefirst general outcry, i heard nothing. i knew, now, that there was nomore reason to fear an attack from this quarter. i had removed the onlymeans of reaching the window, and, as none of the other windows had anyadjacent water pipes, to tempt the climbing powers of the monsters, ibegan to feel more confident of escaping their clutches.leaving the room, i made my way down to the study. i was anxious to seehow the door had withstood the test of that last assault. entering, ilit two of the candles, and then turned to the door. one of the largeprops had been displaced, and, on that side, the door had been forcedinward some six inches.it was providential that i had managed to drive the brutes away justwhen i did! and that copingstone! i wondered, vaguely, how i had managedto dislodge it. i had not noticed it loose, as i took my shot; and then,as i stood up, it had slipped away from beneath me ... i felt that iowed the dismissal of the attacking force, more to its timely fall thanto my rifle. then the thought came, that i had better seize this chanceto shore up the door, again. it was evident that the creatures had notreturned since the fall of the copingstone; but who was to say how longthey would keep away?there and then, i set-to, at repairing the door--working hard andanxiously. first, i went down to the basement, and, rummaging 'round,found several pieces of heavy oak planking. with these, i returned tothe study, and, having removed the props, placed the planks up againstthe door. then, i nailed the heads of the struts to these, and, drivingthem well home at the bottoms, nailed them again there.thus, i made the door stronger than ever; for now it was solid with thebacking of boards, and would, i felt convinced, stand a heavier pressurethan hitherto, without giving way.after that, i lit the lamp which i had brought from the kitchen, andwent down to have a look at the lower windows.now that i had seen an instance of the strength the creaturespossessed, i felt considerable anxiety about the windows on the groundfloor--in spite of the fact that they were so strongly barred.i went first to the buttery, having a vivid remembrance of my lateadventure there. the place was chilly, and the wind, soughing in throughthe broken glass, produced an eerie note. apart from the general air ofdismalness, the place was as i had left it the night before. going up tothe window, i examined the bars, closely; noting, as i did so, theircomfortable thickness. still, as i looked more intently, it seemed tome, that the middle bar was bent slightly from the straight; yet it wasbut trifling, and it might have been so for years. i had never, before,noticed them particularly.i put my hand through the broken window, and shook the bar. it was asfirm as a rock. perhaps the creatures had tried to 'start' it, and,finding it beyond their power, ceased from the effort. after that, iwent 'round to each of the windows, in turn; examining them with carefulattention; but nowhere else could i trace anything to show that therehad been any tampering. having finished my survey, i went back to thestudy, and poured myself out a little brandy. then to the towerto watch._viii_after the attackit was now about three a.m., and, presently, the eastern sky began topale with the coming of dawn. gradually, the day came, and, by itslight, i scanned the gardens, earnestly; but nowhere could i see anysigns of the brutes. i leant over, and glanced down to the foot of thewall, to see whether the body of the thing i had shot the night beforewas still there. it was gone. i supposed that others of the monsters hadremoved it during the night.then, i went down on to the roof, and crossed over to the gap fromwhich the coping stone had fallen. reaching it, i looked over. yes,there was the stone, as i had seen it last; but there was no appearanceof anything beneath it; nor could i see the creatures i had killed,after its fall. evidently, they also had been taken away. i turned, andwent down to my study. there, i sat down, wearily. i was thoroughlytired. it was quite light now; though the sun's rays were not, as yet,perceptibly hot. a clock chimed the hour of four.i awoke, with a start, and looked 'round, hurriedly. the clock in thecorner, indicated that it was three o'clock. it was already afternoon. imust have slept for nearly eleven hours.with a jerky movement, i sat forward in the chair, and listened. thehouse was perfectly silent. slowly, i stood up, and yawned. i feltdesperately tired, still, and sat down again; wondering what it was thathad waked me.it must have been the clock striking, i concluded, presently; and wascommencing to doze off, when a sudden noise brought me back, once more,to life. it was the sound of a step, as of a person moving cautiouslydown the corridor, toward my study. in an instant, i was on my feet, andgrasping my rifle. noiselessly, i waited. had the creatures broken in,whilst i slept? even as i questioned, the steps reached my door, haltedmomentarily, and then continued down the passage. silently, i tiptoed tothe doorway, and peeped out. then, i experienced such a feeling ofrelief, as must a reprieved criminal--it was my sister. she was goingtoward the stairs.i stepped into the hall, and was about to call to her, when it occurredto me, that it was very queer she should have crept past my door, inthat stealthy manner. i was puzzled, and, for one brief moment, thethought occupied my mind, that it was not she, but some fresh mystery ofthe house. then, as i caught a glimpse of her old petticoat, the thoughtpassed as quickly as it had come, and i half laughed. there could be nomistaking that ancient garment. yet, i wondered what she was doing; and,remembering her condition of mind, on the previous day, i felt that itmight be best to follow, quietly--taking care not to alarm her--and seewhat she was going to do. if she behaved rationally, well and good; ifnot, i should have to take steps to restrain her. i could run nounnecessary risks, under the danger that threatened us.quickly, i reached the head of the stairs, and paused a moment. then,i heard a sound that sent me leaping down, at a mad rate--it was therattle of bolts being unshot. that foolish sister of mine was actuallyunbarring the back door.just as her hand was on the last bolt, i reached her. she had not seenme, and, the first thing she knew, i had hold of her arm. she glanced upquickly, like a frightened animal, and screamed aloud.'come, mary!' i said, sternly, 'what's the meaning of this nonsense? doyou mean to tell me you don't understand the danger, that you try tothrow our two lives away in this fashion!'to this, she replied nothing; only trembled, violently, gasping andsobbing, as though in the last extremity of fear.through some minutes, i reasoned with her; pointing out the need forcaution, and asking her to be brave. there was little to be afraid ofnow, i explained--and, i tried to believe that i spoke the truth--butshe must be sensible, and not attempt to leave the house for a few days.at last, i ceased, in despair. it was no use talking to her; she was,obviously, not quite herself for the time being. finally, i told her shehad better go to her room, if she could not behave rationally.still, she took not any notice. so, without more ado, i picked her upin my arms, and carried her there. at first, she screamed, wildly; buthad relapsed into silent trembling, by the time i reached the stairs.arriving at her room, i laid her upon the bed. she lay there quietlyenough, neither speaking nor sobbing--just shaking in a very ague offear. i took a rug from a chair near by, and spread it over her. i coulddo nothing more for her, and so, crossed to where pepper lay in a bigbasket. my sister had taken charge of him since his wound, to nurse him,for it had proved more severe than i had thought, and i was pleased tonote that, in spite of her state of mind, she had looked after the olddog, carefully. stooping, i spoke to him, and, in reply, he licked myhand, feebly. he was too ill to do more.then, going to the bed, i bent over my sister, and asked her how shefelt; but she only shook the more, and, much as it pained me, i had toadmit that my presence seemed to make her worse.and so, i left her--locking the door, and pocketing the key. it seemedto be the only course to take.the rest of the day, i spent between the tower and my study. for food,i brought up a loaf from the pantry, and on this, and some claret, ilived for that day.what a long, weary day it was. if only i could have gone out into thegardens, as is my wont, i should have been content enough; but to becooped in this silent house, with no companion, save a mad woman and asick dog, was enough to prey upon the nerves of the hardiest. and out inthe tangled shrubberies that surrounded the house, lurked--for all icould tell--those infernal swine-creatures waiting their chance. wasever a man in such straits?once, in the afternoon, and again, later, i went to visit my sister.the second time, i found her tending pepper; but, at my approach, sheslid over, unobtrusively, to the far corner, with a gesture thatsaddened me beyond belief. poor girl! her fear cut me intolerably, and iwould not intrude on her, unnecessarily. she would be better, i trusted,in a few days; meanwhile, i could do nothing; and i judged it stillneedful--hard as it seemed--to keep her confined to her room. one thingthere was that i took for encouragement: she had eaten some of the foodi had taken to her, on my first visit.and so the day passed.as the evening drew on, the air grew chilly, and i began to makepreparations for passing a second night in the tower--taking up twoadditional rifles, and a heavy ulster. the rifles i loaded, and laidalongside my other; as i intended to make things warm for any of thecreatures who might show, during the night. i had plenty of ammunition,and i thought to give the brutes such a lesson, as should show them theuselessness of attempting to force an entrance.after that, i made the 'round of the house again; paying particularattention to the props that supported the study door. then, feeling thati had done all that lay in my power to insure our safety, i returned tothe tower; calling in on my sister and pepper, for a final visit, on theway. pepper was asleep; but woke, as i entered, and wagged his tail, inrecognition. i thought he seemed slightly better. my sister was lying onthe bed; though whether asleep or not, i was unable to tell; and thus ileft them.reaching the tower, i made myself as comfortable as circumstances wouldpermit, and settled down to watch through the night. gradually, darknessfell, and soon the details of the gardens were merged into shadows.during the first few hours, i sat, alert, listening for any sound thatmight help to tell me if anything were stirring down below. it was fartoo dark for my eyes to be of much use.slowly, the hours passed; without anything unusual happening. and themoon rose, showing the gardens, apparently empty, and silent. and so,through the night, without disturbance or sound.toward morning, i began to grow stiff and cold, with my long vigil;also, i was getting very uneasy, concerning the continued quietness onthe part of the creatures. i mistrusted it, and would sooner, far, havehad them attack the house, openly. then, at least, i should have knownmy danger, and been able to meet it; but to wait like this, through awhole night, picturing all kinds of unknown devilment, was to jeopardizeone's sanity. once or twice, the thought came to me, that, perhaps, theyhad gone; but, in my heart, i found it impossible to believe that itwas so._ix_in the cellarsat last, what with being tired and cold, and the uneasiness thatpossessed me, i resolved to take a walk through the house; first callingin at the study, for a glass of brandy to warm me. this, i did, and,while there, i examined the door, carefully; but found all as i had leftit the night before.the day was just breaking, as i left the tower; though it was still toodark in the house to be able to see without a light, and i took one ofthe study candles with me on my 'round. by the time i had finished theground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barredwindows. my search had shown me nothing fresh. everything appeared to bein order, and i was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when thethought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round thecellars. i had not, if i remember rightly, been into them since my hastysearch on the evening of the attack.for, perhaps, the half of a minute, i hesitated. i would have been verywilling to forego the task--as, indeed, i am inclined to think any manwell might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, thecellars are the hugest and weirdest. great, gloomy caverns of places,unlit by any ray of daylight. yet, i would not shirk the work. i feltthat to do so would smack of sheer cowardice. besides, as i reassuredmyself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which tocome across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered,only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, i carry always onmy person.it is in the smallest of these places that i keep my wine; a gloomyhole close to the foot of the cellar stairs; and beyond which, i haveseldom proceeded. indeed, save for the rummage 'round, alreadymentioned, i doubt whether i had ever, before, been right throughthe cellars.as i unlocked the great door, at the top of the steps, i paused,nervously, a moment, at the strange, desolate smell that assailed mynostrils. then, throwing the barrel of my weapon forward, i descended,slowly, into the darkness of the underground regions.reaching the bottom of the stairs, i stood for a minute, and listened.all was silent, save for a faint drip, drip of water, falling,drop-by-drop, somewhere to my left. as i stood, i noticed how quietlythe candle burnt; never a flicker nor flare, so utterly windless wasthe place.quietly, i moved from cellar to cellar. i had but a very dim memory oftheir arrangement. the impressions left by my first search were blurred.i had recollections of a succession of great cellars, and of one,greater than the rest, the roof of which was upheld by pillars; beyondthat my mind was hazy, and predominated by a sense of cold and darknessand shadows. now, however, it was different; for, although nervous, iwas sufficiently collected to be able to look about me, and note thestructure and size of the different vaults i entered.of course, with the amount of light given by my candle, it was notpossible to examine each place, minutely, but i was enabled to notice,as i went along, that the walls appeared to be built with wonderfulprecision and finish; while here and there, an occasional, massivepillar shot up to support the vaulted roof.thus, i came, at last, to the great cellar that i remembered. it isreached, through a huge, arched entrance, on which i observed strange,fantastic carvings, which threw queer shadows under the light of mycandle. as i stood, and examined these, thoughtfully, it occurred to mehow strange it was, that i should be so little acquainted with my ownhouse. yet, this may be easily understood, when one realizes the size ofthis ancient pile, and the fact that only my old sister and i live init, occupying a few of the rooms, such as our wants decide.holding the light high, i passed on into the cellar, and, keeping tothe right, paced slowly up, until i reached the further end. i walkedquietly, and looked cautiously about, as i went. but, so far as thelight showed, i saw nothing unusual.at the top, i turned to the left, still keeping to the wall, and socontinued, until i had traversed the whole of the vast chamber. as imoved along, i noticed that the floor was composed of solid rock, inplaces covered with a damp mould, in others bare, or almost so, save fora thin coating of light-grey dust.i had halted at the doorway. now, however, i turned, and made my way upthe center of the place; passing among the pillars, and glancing toright and left, as i moved. about halfway up the cellar, i stubbed myfoot against something that gave out a metallic sound. stooping quickly,i held the candle, and saw that the object i had kicked, was a large,metal ring. bending lower, i cleared the dust from around it, and,presently, discovered that it was attached to a ponderous trap door,black with age.feeling excited, and wondering to where it could lead, i laid my gun onthe floor, and, sticking the candle in the trigger guard, took the ringin both hands, and pulled. the trap creaked loudly--the sound echoing,vaguely, through the huge place--and opened, heavily.propping the edge on my knee, i reached for the candle, and held it inthe opening, moving it to right and left; but could see nothing. i waspuzzled and surprised. there were no signs of steps, nor even theappearance of there ever having been any. nothing; save an emptyblackness. i might have been looking down into a bottomless, sidelesswell. then, even as i stared, full of perplexity, i seemed to hear, fardown, as though from untold depths, a faint whisper of sound. i bent myhead, quickly, more into the opening, and listened, intently. it mayhave been fancy; but i could have sworn to hearing a soft titter, thatgrew into a hideous, chuckling, faint and distant. startled, i leaptbackward, letting the trap fall, with a hollow clang, that filled theplace with echoes. even then, i seemed to hear that mocking, suggestivelaughter; but this, i knew, must be my imagination. the sound, i hadheard, was far too slight to penetrate through the cumbrous trap.for a full minute, i stood there, quivering--glancing, nervously,behind and before; but the great cellar was silent as a grave, and,gradually, i shook off the frightened sensation. with a calmer mind, ibecame again curious to know into what that trap opened; but could not,then, summon sufficient courage to make a further investigation. onething i felt, however, was that the trap ought to be secured. this, iaccomplished by placing upon it several large pieces of 'dressed'stone, which i had noticed in my tour along the east wall.then, after a final scrutiny of the rest of the place, i retraced myway through the cellars, to the stairs, and so reached the daylight,with an infinite feeling of relief, that the uncomfortable task wasaccomplished._x_the time of waitingthe sun was now warm, and shining brightly, forming a wondrous contrastto the dark and dismal cellars; and it was with comparatively lightfeelings, that i made my way up to the tower, to survey the gardens.there, i found everything quiet, and, after a few minutes, went down tomary's room.here, having knocked, and received a reply, i unlocked the door. mysister was sitting, quietly, on the bed; as though waiting. she seemedquite herself again, and made no attempt to move away, as i approached;yet, i observed that she scanned my face, anxiously, as though in doubt,and but half assured in her mind that there was nothing to fear from me.to my questions, as to how she felt, she replied, sanely enough, thatshe was hungry, and would like to go down to prepare breakfast, if i didnot mind. for a minute, i meditated whether it would be safe to let herout. finally, i told her she might go, on condition that she promisednot to attempt to leave the house, or meddle with any of the outerdoors. at my mention of the doors, a sudden look of fright crossed herface; but she said nothing, save to give the required promise, and thenleft the room, silently.crossing the floor, i approached pepper. he had waked as i entered;but, beyond a slight yelp of pleasure, and a soft rapping with his tail,had kept quiet. now, as i patted him, he made an attempt to stand up,and succeeded, only to fall back on his side, with a little yowlof pain.i spoke to him, and bade him lie still. i was greatly delighted withhis improvement, and also with the natural kindness of my sister'sheart, in taking such good care of him, in spite of her condition ofmind. after a while, i left him, and went downstairs, to my study.in a little time, mary appeared, carrying a tray on which smoked a hotbreakfast. as she entered the room, i saw her gaze fasten on the propsthat supported the study door; her lips tightened, and i thought shepaled, slightly; but that was all. putting the tray down at my elbow,she was leaving the room, quietly, when i called her back. she came, itseemed, a little timidly, as though startled; and i noted that her handclutched at her apron, nervously.'come, mary,' i said. 'cheer up! things look brighter. i've seen noneof the creatures since yesterday morning, early.'she looked at me, in a curiously puzzled manner; as though notcomprehending. then, intelligence swept into her eyes, and fear; but shesaid nothing, beyond an unintelligible murmur of acquiescence. afterthat, i kept silence; it was evident that any reference to theswine-things, was more than her shaken nerves could bear.breakfast over, i went up to the tower. here, during the greater partof the day, i maintained a strict watch over the gardens. once or twice,i went down to the basement, to see how my sister was getting along.each time, i found her quiet, and curiously submissive. indeed, on thelast occasion, she even ventured to address me, on her own account, withregard to some household matter that needed attention. though this wasdone with an almost extraordinary timidity, i hailed it with happiness,as being the first word, voluntarily spoken, since the critical moment,when i had caught her unbarring the back door, to go out among thosewaiting brutes. i wondered whether she was aware of her attempt, and hownear a thing it had been; but refrained from questioning her, thinkingit best to let well alone.that night, i slept in a bed; the first time for two nights. in themorning, i rose early, and took a walk through the house. all was as itshould be, and i went up to the tower, to have a look at the gardens.here, again, i found perfect quietness.at breakfast, when i met mary, i was greatly pleased to see that shehad sufficiently regained command over herself, to be able to greet mein a perfectly natural manner. she talked sensibly and quietly; onlykeeping carefully from any mention of the past couple of days. in this,i humored her, to the extent of not attempting to lead the conversationin that direction.earlier in the morning, i had been to see pepper. he was mending,rapidly; and bade fair to be on his legs, in earnest, in another day ortwo. before leaving the breakfast table, i made some reference to hisimprovement. in the short discussion that followed, i was surprised togather, from my sister's remarks, that she was still under theimpression that his wound had been given by the wildcat, of myinvention. it made me feel almost ashamed of myself for deceiving her.yet, the lie had been told to prevent her from being frightened. andthen, i had been sure that she must have known the truth, later, whenthose brutes had attacked the house.during the day, i kept on the alert; spending much of my time, as onthe previous day, in the tower; but not a sign could i see of theswine-creatures, nor hear any sound. several times, the thought had cometo me, that the things had, at last, left us; but, up to this time, ihad refused to entertain the idea, seriously; now, however, i began tofeel that there was reason for hope. it would soon be three days since ihad seen any of the things; but still, i intended to use the utmostcaution. for all that i could tell, this protracted silence might be aruse to tempt me from the house--perhaps right into their arms. thethought of such a contingency, was, alone, sufficient to make mecircumspect.so it was, that the fourth, fifth and sixth days went by, quietly,without my making any attempt to leave the house.on the sixth day, i had the pleasure of seeing pepper, once more, uponhis feet; and, though still very weak, he managed to keep me companyduring the whole of that day._xi_the searching of the gardenshow slowly the time went; and never a thing to indicate that any of thebrutes still infested the gardens.it was on the ninth day that, finally, i decided to run the risk, ifany there were, and sally out. with this purpose in view, i loaded oneof the shotguns, carefully--choosing it, as being more deadly than arifle, at close quarters; and then, after a final scrutiny of thegrounds, from the tower, i called pepper to follow me, and made my waydown to the basement.at the door, i must confess to hesitating a moment. the thought of whatmight be awaiting me among the dark shrubberies, was by no meanscalculated to encourage my resolution. it was but a second, though, andthen i had drawn the bolts, and was standing on the path outsidethe door.pepper followed, stopping at the doorstep to sniff, suspiciously; andcarrying his nose up and down the jambs, as though following a scent.then, suddenly, he turned, sharply, and started to run here and there,in semicircles and circles, all around the door; finally returning tothe threshold. here, he began again to nose about.hitherto, i had stood, watching the dog; yet, all the time, with halfmy gaze on the wild tangle of gardens, stretching 'round me. now, i wenttoward him, and, bending down, examined the surface of the door, wherehe was smelling. i found that the wood was covered with a network ofscratches, crossing and recrossing one another, in inextricableconfusion. in addition to this, i noticed that the doorposts,themselves, were gnawed in places. beyond these, i could find nothing;and so, standing up, i began to make the tour of the house wall.pepper, as soon as i walked away, left the door, and ran ahead, stillnosing and sniffing as he went along. at times, he stopped toinvestigate. here, it would be a bullet-hole in the pathway, or,perhaps, a powder stained wad. anon, it might be a piece of torn sod, ora disturbed patch of weedy path; but, save for such trifles, he foundnothing. i observed him, critically, as he went along, and coulddiscover nothing of uneasiness, in his demeanor, to indicate that hefelt the nearness of any of the creatures. by this, i was assured thatthe gardens were empty, at least for the present, of those hatefulthings. pepper could not be easily deceived, and it was a relief to feelthat he would know, and give me timely warning, if there wereany danger.reaching the place where i had shot that first creature, i stopped, andmade a careful scrutiny; but could see nothing. from there, i went on towhere the great copingstone had fallen. it lay on its side, apparentlyjust as it had been left when i shot the brute that was moving it. acouple of feet to the right of the nearer end, was a great dent in theground; showing where it had struck. the other end was still within theindentation--half in, and half out. going nearer, i looked at the stone,more closely. what a huge piece of masonry it was! and that creature hadmoved it, single-handed, in its attempt to reach what lay below.i went 'round to the further end of the stone. here, i found that itwas possible to see under it, for a distance of nearly a couple of feet.still, i could see nothing of the stricken creatures, and i felt muchsurprised. i had, as i have before said, guessed that the remains hadbeen removed; yet, i could not conceive that it had been done sothoroughly as not to leave some certain sign, beneath the stone,indicative of their fate. i had seen several of the brutes struck downbeneath it, with such force that they must have been literally driveninto the earth; and now, not a vestige of them was to be seen--not evena bloodstain.i felt more puzzled, than ever, as i turned the matter over in my mind;but could think of no plausible explanation; and so, finally, gave itup, as one of the many things that were unexplainable.from there, i transferred my attention to the study door. i could see,now, even more plainly, the effects of the tremendous strain, to whichit had been subjected; and i marveled how, even with the supportafforded by the props, it had withstood the attacks, so well. there wereno marks of blows--indeed, none had been given--but the door had beenliterally riven from its hinges, by the application of enormous, silentforce. one thing that i observed affected me profoundly--the head of oneof the props had been driven right through a panel. this was, of itself,sufficient to show how huge an effort the creatures had made to breakdown the door, and how nearly they had succeeded.leaving, i continued my tour 'round the house, finding little else ofinterest; save at the back, where i came across the piece of piping ihad torn from the wall, lying among the long grass underneath thebroken window.then, i returned to the house, and, having re-bolted the back door,went up to the tower. here, i spent the afternoon, reading, andoccasionally glancing down into the gardens. i had determined, if thenight passed quietly, to go as far as the pit, on the morrow. perhaps, ishould be able to learn, then, something of what had happened. the dayslipped away, and the night came, and went much as the last fewnights had gone.when i rose the morning had broken, fine and clear; and i determined toput my project into action. during breakfast, i considered the matter,carefully; after which, i went to the study for my shotgun. in addition,i loaded, and slipped into my pocket, a small, but heavy, pistol. iquite understood that, if there were any danger, it lay in the directionof the pit and i intended to be prepared.leaving the study, i went down to the back door, followed by pepper.once outside, i took a quick survey of the surrounding gardens, and thenset off toward the pit. on the way, i kept a sharp outlook, holding mygun, handily. pepper was running ahead, i noticed, without any apparenthesitation. from this, i augured that there was no imminent danger to beapprehended, and i stepped out more quickly in his wake. he had reachedthe top of the pit, now, and was nosing his way along the edge.a minute later, i was beside him, looking down into the pit. for amoment, i could scarcely believe that it was the same place, so greatlywas it changed. the dark, wooded ravine of a fortnight ago, with afoliage-hidden stream, running sluggishly, at the bottom, existed nolonger. instead, my eyes showed me a ragged chasm, partly filled with agloomy lake of turbid water. all one side of the ravine was stripped ofunderwood, showing the bare rock.a little to my left, the side of the pit appeared to have collapsedaltogether, forming a deep v-shaped cleft in the face of the rockycliff. this rift ran, from the upper edge of the ravine, nearly down tothe water, and penetrated into the pit side, to a distance of some fortyfeet. its opening was, at least, six yards across; and, from this, itseemed to taper into about two. but, what attracted my attention, morethan even the stupendous split itself, was a great hole, some distancedown the cleft, and right in the angle of the v. it was clearly defined,and not unlike an arched doorway in shape; though, lying as it did inthe shadow, i could not see it very distinctly.the opposite side of the pit, still retained its verdure; but so tornin places, and everywhere covered with dust and rubbish, that it washardly distinguishable as such.my first impression, that there had been a land slip, was, i began tosee, not sufficient, of itself, to account for all the changes iwitnessed. and the water--? i turned, suddenly; for i had become awarethat, somewhere to my right, there was a noise of running water. i couldsee nothing; but, now that my attention had been caught, idistinguished, easily, that it came from somewhere at the east endof the pit.slowly, i made my way in that direction; the sound growing plainer as iadvanced, until in a little, i stood right above it. even then, i couldnot perceive the cause, until i knelt down, and thrust my head over thecliff. here, the noise came up to me, plainly; and i saw, below me, atorrent of clear water, issuing from a small fissure in the pit side,and rushing down the rocks, into the lake beneath. a little furtheralong the cliff, i saw another, and, beyond that again, two smallerones. these, then, would help to account for the quantity of water inthe pit; and, if the fall of rock and earth had blocked the outlet ofthe stream at the bottom, there was little doubt but that it wascontributing a very large share.yet, i puzzled my head to account for the generally _shaken_ appearanceof the place--these streamlets, and that huge cleft, further up theravine! it seemed to me, that more than the landslip was necessary toaccount for these. i could imagine an earthquake, or a great_explosion_, creating some such condition of affairs as existed; but, ofthese, there had been neither. then, i stood up, quickly, rememberingthat crash, and the cloud of dust that had followed, directly, rushinghigh into the air. but i shook my head, unbelievingly. no! it must havebeen the noise of the falling rocks and earth, i had heard; of course,the dust would fly, naturally. still, in spite of my reasoning, i had anuneasy feeling, that this theory did not satisfy my sense of theprobable; and yet, was any other, that i could suggest, likely to behalf so plausible? pepper had been sitting on the grass, while iconducted my examination. now, as i turned up the north side of theravine, he rose and followed.slowly, and keeping a careful watch in all directions, i made thecircuit of the pit; but found little else, that i had not already seen.from the west end, i could see the four waterfalls, uninterruptedly.they were some considerable distance up from the surface of thelake--about fifty feet, i calculated.for a little while longer, i loitered about; keeping my eyes and earsopen, but still, without seeing or hearing anything suspicious. thewhole place was wonderfully quiet; indeed, save for the continuousmurmur of the water, at the top end, no sound, of any description, brokethe silence.all this while, pepper had shown no signs of uneasiness. this seemed,to me, to indicate that, for the time being, at least, there was none ofthe swine-creatures in the vicinity. so far as i could see, hisattention appeared to have been taken, chiefly, with scratching andsniffing among the grass at the edge of the pit. at times, he wouldleave the edge, and run along toward the house, as though followinginvisible tracks; but, in all cases, returning after a few minutes. ihad little doubt but that he was really tracing out the footsteps of theswine-things; and the very fact that each one seemed to lead him back tothe pit, appeared to me, a proof that the brutes had all returned whencethey came.at noon, i went home, for dinner. during the afternoon, i made apartial search of the gardens, accompanied by pepper; but, withoutcoming upon anything to indicate the presence of the creatures.once, as we made our way through the shrubberies, pepper rushed inamong some bushes, with a fierce yelp. at that, i jumped back, in suddenfright, and threw my gun forward, in readiness; only to laugh,nervously, as pepper reappeared, chasing an unfortunate cat. towardevening, i gave up the search, and returned to the house. all at once,as we were passing a great clump of bushes, on our right, pepperdisappeared, and i could hear him sniffing and growling among them, in asuspicious manner. with my gun barrel, i parted the interveningshrubbery, and looked inside. there was nothing to be seen, save thatmany of the branches were bent down, and broken; as though some animalhad made a lair there, at no very previous date. it was probably, ithought, one of the places occupied by some of the swine-creatures, onthe night of the attack.next day, i resumed my search through the gardens; but without result.by evening, i had been right through them, and now, i knew, beyond thepossibility of doubt, that there were no longer any of the thingsconcealed about the place. indeed, i have often thought since, that iwas correct in my earlier surmise, that they had left soon afterthe attack._xii_the subterranean pitanother week came and went, during which i spent a great deal of my timeabout the pit mouth. i had come to the conclusion a few days earlier,that the arched hole, in the angle of the great rift, was the placethrough which the swine-things had made their exit, from some unholyplace in the bowels of the world. how near the probable truth this went,i was to learn later.it may be easily understood, that i was tremendously curious, though ina frightened way, to know to what infernal place that hole led; though,so far, the idea had not struck me, seriously, of making aninvestigation. i was far too much imbued with a sense of horror of theswine-creatures, to think of venturing, willingly, where there was anychance of coming into contact with them.gradually, however, as time passed, this feeling grew insensibly less;so that when, a few days later, the thought occurred to me that it mightbe possible to clamber down and have a look into the hole, i was not soexceedingly averse to it, as might have been imagined. still, i do notthink, even then, that i really intended to try any such foolhardyadventure. for all that i could tell, it might be certain death, toenter that doleful looking opening. and yet, such is the pertinacity ofhuman curiosity, that, at last, my chief desire was but to discover whatlay beyond that gloomy entrance.slowly, as the days slid by, my fear of the swine-things became anemotion of the past--more an unpleasant, incredible memory, thanaught else.thus, a day came, when, throwing thoughts and fancies adrift, iprocured a rope from the house, and, having made it fast to a stouttree, at the top of the rift, and some little distance back from the pitedge, let the other end down into the cleft, until it dangled rightacross the mouth of the dark hole.then, cautiously, and with many misgivings as to whether it was not amad act that i was attempting, i climbed slowly down, using the rope asa support, until i reached the hole. here, still holding on to the rope,i stood, and peered in. all was perfectly dark, and not a sound came tome. yet, a moment later, it seemed that i could hear something. i heldmy breath, and listened; but all was silent as the grave, and i breathedfreely once more. at the same instant, i heard the sound again. it waslike a noise of labored breathing--deep and sharp-drawn. for a shortsecond, i stood, petrified; not able to move. but now the sounds hadceased again, and i could hear nothing.as i stood there, anxiously, my foot dislodged a pebble, which fellinward, into the dark, with a hollow chink. at once, the noise was takenup and repeated a score of times; each succeeding echo being fainter,and seeming to travel away from me, as though into remote distance.then, as the silence fell again, i heard that stealthy breathing. foreach respiration i made, i could hear an answering breath. the soundsappeared to be coming nearer; and then, i heard several others; butfainter and more distant. why i did not grip the rope, and spring up outof danger, i cannot say. it was as though i had been paralyzed. i brokeout into a profuse sweat, and tried to moisten my lips with my tongue.my throat had gone suddenly dry, and i coughed, huskily. it came back tome, in a dozen, horrible, throaty tones, mockingly. i peered,helplessly, into the gloom; but still nothing showed. i had a strange,choky sensation, and again i coughed, dryly. again the echo took it up,rising and falling, grotesquely, and dying slowly into amuffled silence.then, suddenly, a thought came to me, and i held my breath. the otherbreathing stopped. i breathed again, and, once more, it re-commenced.but now, i no longer feared. i knew that the strange sounds were notmade by any lurking swine-creature; but were simply the echo of my ownrespirations.yet, i had received such a fright, that i was glad to scramble up therift, and haul up the rope. i was far too shaken and nervous to think ofentering that dark hole then, and so returned to the house. i felt moremyself next morning; but even then, i could not summon up sufficientcourage to explore the place.all this time, the water in the pit had been creeping slowly up, andnow stood but a little below the opening. at the rate at which it wasrising, it would be level with the floor in less than another week; andi realized that, unless i carried out my investigations soon, i shouldprobably never do so at all; as the water would rise and rise, until theopening, itself, was submerged.it may have been that this thought stirred me to act; but, whatever itwas, a couple of days later, saw me standing at the top of the cleft,fully equipped for the task.this time, i was resolved to conquer my shirking, and go right throughwith the matter. with this intention, i had brought, in addition to therope, a bundle of candles, meaning to use them as a torch; also mydouble-barreled shotgun. in my belt, i had a heavy horse-pistol, loadedwith buckshot.as before, i fastened the rope to the tree. then, having tied my gunacross my shoulders, with a piece of stout cord, i lowered myself overthe edge of the pit. at this movement, pepper, who had been eyeing myactions, watchfully, rose to his feet, and ran to me, with a half bark,half wail, it seemed to me, of warning. but i was resolved on myenterprise, and bade him lie down. i would much have liked to take himwith me; but this was next to impossible, in the existing circumstances.as my face dropped level with the pit edge, he licked me, right acrossthe mouth; and then, seizing my sleeve between his teeth, began to pullback, strongly. it was very evident that he did not want me to go. yet,having made up my mind, i had no intention of giving up the attempt;and, with a sharp word to pepper, to release me, i continued my descent,leaving the poor old fellow at the top, barking and crying like aforsaken pup.carefully, i lowered myself from projection to projection. i knew thata slip might mean a wetting.reaching the entrance, i let go the rope, and untied the gun from myshoulders. then, with a last look at the sky--which i noticed wasclouding over, rapidly--i went forward a couple of paces, so as to beshielded from the wind, and lit one of the candles. holding it above myhead, and grasping my gun, firmly, i began to move on, slowly, throwingmy glances in all directions.for the first minute, i could hear the melancholy sound of pepper'showling, coming down to me. gradually, as i penetrated further into thedarkness, it grew fainter; until, in a little while, i could hearnothing. the path tended downward somewhat, and to the left. thence itkept on, still running to the left, until i found that it was leading meright in the direction of the house.very cautiously, i moved onward, stopping, every few steps, to listen.i had gone, perhaps, a hundred yards, when, suddenly, it seemed to methat i caught a faint sound, somewhere along the passage behind. with myheart thudding heavily, i listened. the noise grew plainer, and appearedto be approaching, rapidly. i could hear it distinctly, now. it was thesoft padding of running feet. in the first moments of fright, i stood,irresolute; not knowing whether to go forward or backward. then, with asudden realization of the best thing to do, i backed up to the rockywall on my right, and, holding the candle above my head, waited--gun inhand--cursing my foolhardy curiosity, for bringing me into sucha strait.i had not long to wait, but a few seconds, before two eyes reflectedback from the gloom, the rays of my candle. i raised my gun, using myright hand only, and aimed quickly. even as i did so, something leaptout of the darkness, with a blustering bark of joy that woke the echoes,like thunder. it was pepper. how he had contrived to scramble down thecleft, i could not conceive. as i brushed my hand, nervously, over hiscoat, i noticed that he was dripping; and concluded that he must havetried to follow me, and fallen into the water; from which he would notfind it very difficult to climb.having waited a minute, or so, to steady myself, i proceeded along theway, pepper following, quietly. i was curiously glad to have the oldfellow with me. he was company, and, somehow, with him at my heels, iwas less afraid. also, i knew how quickly his keen ears would detect thepresence of any unwelcome creature, should there be such, amid thedarkness that wrapped us.for some minutes we went slowly along; the path still leading straighttoward the house. soon, i concluded, we should be standing right beneathit, did the path but carry far enough. i led the way, cautiously, foranother fifty yards, or so. then, i stopped, and held the light high;and reason enough i had to be thankful that i did so; for there, notthree paces forward, the path vanished, and, in place, showed a hollowblackness, that sent sudden fear through me.very cautiously, i crept forward, and peered down; but could seenothing. then, i crossed to the left of the passage, to see whetherthere might be any continuation of the path. here, right against thewall, i found that a narrow track, some three feet wide, led onward.carefully, i stepped on to it; but had not gone far, before i regrettedventuring thereon. for, after a few paces, the already narrow way,resolved itself into a mere ledge, with, on the one side the solid,unyielding rock, towering up, in a great wall, to the unseen roof, and,on the other, that yawning chasm. i could not help reflecting howhelpless i was, should i be attacked there, with no room to turn, andwhere even the recoil of my weapon might be sufficient to drive meheadlong into the depths below.to my great relief, a little further on, the track suddenly broadenedout again to its original breadth. gradually, as i went onward, inoticed that the path trended steadily to the right, and so, after someminutes, i discovered that i was not going forward; but simply circlingthe huge abyss. i had, evidently, come to the end of the great passage.five minutes later, i stood on the spot from which i had started;having been completely 'round, what i guessed now to be a vast pit, themouth of which must be at least a hundred yards across.for some little time, i stood there, lost in perplexing thought. 'whatdoes it all mean?' was the cry that had begun to reiterate throughmy brain.a sudden idea struck me, and i searched 'round for a piece of stone.presently, i found a bit of rock, about the size of a small loaf.sticking the candle upright in a crevice of the floor, i went back fromthe edge, somewhat, and, taking a short run, launched the stone forwardinto the chasm--my idea being to throw it far enough to keep it clear ofthe sides. then, i stooped forward, and listened; but, though i keptperfectly quiet, for at least a full minute, no sound came back to mefrom out of the dark.i knew, then, that the depth of the hole must be immense; for thestone, had it struck anything, was large enough to have set the echoesof that weird place, whispering for an indefinite period. even as itwas, the cavern had given back the sounds of my footfalls,multitudinously. the place was awesome, and i would willingly haveretraced my steps, and left the mysteries of its solitudes unsolved;only, to do so, meant admitting defeat.then, a thought came, to try to get a view of the abyss. it occurred tome that, if i placed my candles 'round the edge of the hole, i should beable to get, at least, some dim sight of the place.i found, on counting, that i had brought fifteen candles, in thebundle--my first intention having been, as i have already said, to makea torch of the lot. these, i proceeded to place 'round the pit mouth,with an interval of about twenty yards between each.having completed the circle, i stood in the passage, and endeavored toget an idea of how the place looked. but i discovered, immediately, thatthey were totally insufficient for my purpose. they did little more thanmake the gloom visible. one thing they did, however, and that was, theyconfirmed my opinion of the size of the opening; and, although theyshowed me nothing that i wanted to see; yet the contrast they affordedto the heavy darkness, pleased me, curiously. it was as though fifteentiny stars shone through the subterranean night.then, even as i stood, pepper gave a sudden howl, that was taken up bythe echoes, and repeated with ghastly variations, dying away, slowly.with a quick movement, i held aloft the one candle that i had kept, andglanced down at the dog; at the same moment, i seemed to hear a noise,like a diabolical chuckle, rise up from the hitherto, silent depths ofthe pit. i started; then, i recollected that it was, probably, the echoof pepper's howl.pepper had moved away from me, up the passage, a few steps; he wasnosing along the rocky floor; and i thought i heard him lapping. i wenttoward him, holding the candle low. as i moved, i heard my boot go sop,sop; and the light was reflected from something that glistened, andcrept past my feet, swiftly toward the pit. i bent lower, and looked;then gave vent to an expression of surprise. from somewhere, higher upthe path, a stream of water was running quickly in the direction of thegreat opening, and growing in size every second.again, pepper gave vent to that deep-drawn howl, and, running at me,seized my coat, and attempted to drag me up the path toward theentrance. with a nervous gesture, i shook him off, and crossed quicklyover to the left-hand wall. if anything were coming, i was going to havethe wall at my back.then, as i stared anxiously up the pathway, my candle caught a gleam,far up the passage. at the same moment, i became conscious of amurmurous roar, that grew louder, and filled the whole cavern withdeafening sound. from the pit, came a deep, hollow echo, like the sob ofa giant. then, i had sprung to one side, on to the narrow ledge that ran'round the abyss, and, turning, saw a great wall of foam sweep past me,and leap tumultuously into the waiting chasm. a cloud of spray burstover me, extinguishing my candle, and wetting me to the skin. i stillheld my gun. the three nearest candles went out; but the further onesgave only a short flicker. after the first rush, the flow of water easeddown to a steady stream, maybe a foot in depth; though i could not seethis, until i had procured one of the lighted candles, and, with it,started to reconnoiter. pepper had, fortunately, followed me as i leaptfor the ledge, and now, very much subdued, kept close behind.a short examination showed me that the water reached right across thepassage, and was running at a tremendous rate. already, even as i stoodthere, it had deepened. i could make only a guess at what had happened.evidently, the water in the ravine had broken into the passage, by somemeans. if that were the case, it would go on increasing in volume, untili should find it impossible to leave the place. the thought wasfrightening. it was evident that i must make my exit as hurriedlyas possible.taking my gun by the stock, i sounded the water. it was a little underknee-deep. the noise it made, plunging down into the pit, was deafening.then, with a call to pepper, i stepped out into the flood, using the gunas a staff. instantly, the water boiled up over my knees, and nearly tothe tops of my thighs, with the speed at which it was racing. for oneshort moment, i nearly lost my footing; but the thought of what laybehind, stimulated me to a fierce endeavor, and, step-by-step, imade headway.of pepper, i knew nothing at first. i had all i could do to keep on mylegs; and was overjoyed, when he appeared beside me. he was wadingmanfully along. he is a big dog, with longish thin legs, and i supposethe water had less grasp on them, than upon mine. anyway, he managed agreat deal better than i did; going ahead of me, like a guide, andwittingly--or otherwise--helping, somewhat, to break the force of thewater. on we went, step by step, struggling and gasping, until somewhereabout a hundred yards had been safely traversed. then, whether it wasbecause i was taking less care, or that there was a slippery place onthe rocky floor, i cannot say; but, suddenly, i slipped, and fell on myface. instantly, the water leapt over me in a cataract, hurling me down,toward that bottomless hole, at a frightful speed. frantically istruggled; but it was impossible to get a footing. i was helpless,gasping and drowning. all at once, something gripped my coat, andbrought me to a standstill. it was pepper. missing me, he must haveraced back, through the dark turmoil, to find me, and then caught, andheld me, until i was able to get to my feet.i have a dim recollection of having seen, momentarily, the gleams ofseveral lights; but, of this, i have never been quite sure. if myimpressions are correct, i must have been washed down to the very brinkof that awful chasm, before pepper managed to bring me to a standstill.and the lights, of course, could only have been the distant flames ofthe candles, i had left burning. but, as i have said, i am not by anymeans sure. my eyes were full of water, and i had been badly shaken.and there was i, without my helpful gun, without light, and sadlyconfused, with the water deepening; depending solely upon my old friendpepper, to help me out of that hellish place.i was facing the torrent. naturally, it was the only way in which icould have sustained my position a moment; for even old pepper could nothave held me long against that terrific strain, without assistance,however blind, from me.perhaps a minute passed, during which it was touch and go with me;then, gradually i re-commenced my tortuous way up the passage. and sobegan the grimmest fight with death, from which ever i hope to emergevictorious. slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, i strove; and thatfaithful pepper led me, dragged me, upward and onward, until, at last,ahead i saw a gleam of blessed light. it was the entrance. only a fewyards further, and i reached the opening, with the water surging andboiling hungrily around my loins.and now i understood the cause of the catastrophe. it was rainingheavily, literally in torrents. the surface of the lake was level withthe bottom of the opening--nay! more than level, it was above it.evidently, the rain had swollen the lake, and caused this prematurerise; for, at the rate the ravine had been filling, it would not havereached the entrance for a couple more days.luckily, the rope by which i had descended, was streaming into theopening, upon the inrushing waters. seizing the end, i knotted itsecurely 'round pepper's body, then, summoning up the last remnant of mystrength, i commenced to swarm up the side of the cliff. i reached thepit edge, in the last stage of exhaustion. yet, i had to make one moreeffort, and haul pepper into safety.slowly and wearily, i hauled on the rope. once or twice, it seemed thati should have to give up; for pepper is a weighty dog, and i was utterlydone. yet, to let go, would have meant certain death to the old fellow,and the thought spurred me to greater exertions. i have but a very hazyremembrance of the end. i recall pulling, through moments that laggedstrangely. i have also some recollection of seeing pepper's muzzle,appearing over the pit edge, after what seemed an indefinite period oftime. then, all grew suddenly dark._xiii_the trap in the great cellari suppose i must have swooned; for, the next thing i remember, i openedmy eyes, and all was dusk. i was lying on my back, with one leg doubledunder the other, and pepper was licking my ears. i felt horribly stiff,and my leg was numb, from the knee, downward. for a few minutes, i laythus, in a dazed condition; then, slowly, i struggled to a sittingposition, and looked about me.it had stopped raining, but the trees still dripped, dismally. from thepit, came a continuous murmur of running water. i felt cold and shivery.my clothes were sodden, and i ached all over. very slowly, the life cameback into my numbed leg, and, after a little, i essayed to stand up.this, i managed, at the second attempt; but i was very tottery, andpeculiarly weak. it seemed to me, that i was going to be ill, and i madeshift to stumble my way toward the house. my steps were erratic, and myhead confused. at each step that i took, sharp pains shot throughmy limbs.i had gone, perhaps, some thirty paces, when a cry from pepper, drewmy attention, and i turned, stiffly, toward him. the old dog was tryingto follow me; but could come no further, owing to the rope, with which ihad hauled him up, being still tied 'round his body, the other end nothaving been unfastened from the tree. for a moment, i fumbled with theknots, weakly; but they were wet and hard, and i could do nothing. then,i remembered my knife, and, in a minute, the rope was cut.how i reached the house, i scarcely know, and, of the days thatfollowed, i remember still less. of one thing, i am certain, that, hadit not been for my sister's untiring love and nursing, i had not beenwriting at this moment.when i recovered my senses, it was to find that i had been in bed fornearly two weeks. yet another week passed, before i was strong enough tototter out into the gardens. even then, i was not able to walk so far asthe pit. i would have liked to ask my sister, how high the water hadrisen; but felt it was wiser not to mention the subject to her. indeed,since then, i have made a rule never to speak to her about the strangethings, that happen in this great, old house.it was not until a couple of days later, that i managed to get acrossto the pit. there, i found that, in my few weeks' absence, there hadbeen wrought a wondrous change. instead of the three-parts filledravine, i looked out upon a great lake, whose placid surface, reflectedthe light, coldly. the water had risen to within half a dozen feet ofthe pit edge. only in one part was the lake disturbed, and that wasabove the place where, far down under the silent waters, yawned theentrance to the vast, underground pit. here, there was a continuousbubbling; and, occasionally, a curious sort of sobbing gurgle would findits way up from the depth. beyond these, there was nothing to tell ofthe things that were hidden beneath. as i stood there, it came to mehow wonderfully things had worked out. the entrance to the place whencethe swine-creatures had come, was sealed up, by a power that made mefeel there was nothing more to fear from them. and yet, with thefeeling, there was a sensation that, now, i should never learn anythingfurther, of the place from which those dreadful things had come. it wascompletely shut off and concealed from human curiosity forever.strange--in the knowledge of that underground hell-hole--how appositehas been the naming of the pit. one wonders how it originated, and when.naturally, one concludes that the shape and depth of the ravine wouldsuggest the name 'pit.' yet, is it not possible that it has, all along,held a deeper significance, a hint--could one but have guessed--of thegreater, more stupendous pit that lies far down in the earth, beneaththis old house? under this house! even now, the idea is strange andterrible to me. for i have proved, beyond doubt, that the pit yawnsright below the house, which is evidently supported, somewhere above thecenter of it, upon a tremendous, arched roof, of solid rock.it happened in this wise, that, having occasion to go down to thecellars, the thought occurred to me to pay a visit to the great vault,where the trap is situated; and see whether everything was as i hadleft it.reaching the place, i walked slowly up the center, until i came to thetrap. there it was, with the stones piled upon it, just as i had seen itlast. i had a lantern with me, and the idea came to me, that now wouldbe a good time to investigate whatever lay under the great, oak slab.placing the lantern on the floor, i tumbled the stones off the trap,and, grasping the ring, pulled the door open. as i did so, the cellarbecame filled with the sound of a murmurous thunder, that rose from farbelow. at the same time, a damp wind blew up into my face, bringingwith it a load of fine spray. therewith, i dropped the trap, hurriedly,with a half frightened feeling of wonder.for a moment, i stood puzzled. i was not particularly afraid. thehaunting fear of the swine-things had left me, long ago; but i wascertainly nervous and astonished. then, a sudden thought possessed me,and i raised the ponderous door, with a feeling of excitement. leavingit standing upon its end, i seized the lantern, and, kneeling down,thrust it into the opening. as i did so, the moist wind and spray drovein my eyes, making me unable to see, for a few moments. even when myeyes were clear, i could distinguish nothing below me, save darkness,and whirling spray.seeing that it was useless to expect to make out anything, with thelight so high, i felt in my pockets for a piece of twine, with which tolower it further into the opening. even as i fumbled, the lanternslipped from my fingers, and hurtled down into the darkness. for a briefinstant, i watched its fall, and saw the light shine on a tumult ofwhite foam, some eighty or a hundred feet below me. then it was gone. mysudden surmise was correct, and now, i knew the cause of the wet andnoise. the great cellar was connected with the pit, by means of thetrap, which opened right above it; and the moisture, was the spray,rising from the water, falling into the depths.in an instant, i had an explanation of certain things, that hadhitherto puzzled me. now, i could understand why the noises--on thefirst night of the invasion--had seemed to rise directly from under myfeet. and the chuckle that had sounded when first i opened the trap!evidently, some of the swine-things must have been right beneath me.another thought struck me. were the creatures all drowned? would theydrown? i remembered how unable i had been to find any traces to showthat my shooting had been really fatal. had they life, as we understandlife, or were they ghouls? these thoughts flashed through my brain, as istood in the dark, searching my pockets for matches. i had the box in myhand now, and, striking a light, i stepped to the trap door, and closedit. then, i piled the stones back upon it; after which, i made my wayout from the cellars.and so, i suppose the water goes on, thundering down into thatbottomless hell-pit. sometimes, i have an inexplicable desire to go downto the great cellar, open the trap, and gaze into the impenetrable,spray-damp darkness. at times, the desire becomes almost overpowering,in its intensity. it is not mere curiosity, that prompts me; but more asthough some unexplained influence were at work. still, i never go; andintend to fight down the strange longing, and crush it; even as i wouldthe unholy thought of self-destruction.this idea of some intangible force being exerted, may seem reasonless.yet, my instinct warns me, that it is not so. in these things, reasonseems to me less to be trusted than instinct.one thought there is, in closing, that impresses itself upon me, withever growing insistence. it is, that i live in a very strange house; avery awful house. and i have begun to wonder whether i am doing wiselyin staying here. yet, if i left, where could i go, and still obtain thesolitude, and the sense of her presence,[1] that alone make my oldlife bearable?_xiv_the sea of sleepfor a considerable period after the last incident which i have narratedin my diary, i had serious thoughts of leaving this house, and mighthave done so; but for the great and wonderful thing, of which i amabout to write.how well i was advised, in my heart, when i stayed on here--spite ofthose visions and sights of unknown and unexplainable things; for, had inot stayed, then i had not seen again the face of her i loved. yes,though few know it, none now save my sister mary, i have loved and,ah! me--lost.i would write down the story of those sweet, old days; but it would belike the tearing of old wounds; yet, after that which has happened, whatneed have i to care? for she has come to me out of the unknown.strangely, she warned me; warned me passionately against this house;begged me to leave it; but admitted, when i questioned her, that shecould not have come to me, had i been elsewhere. yet, in spite of this,still she warned me, earnestly; telling me that it was a place, longago given over to evil, and under the power of grim laws, of which nonehere have knowledge. and i--i just asked her, again, whether she wouldcome to me elsewhere, and she could only stand, silent.it was thus, that i came to the place of the sea of sleep--so shetermed it, in her dear speech with me. i had stayed up, in my study,reading; and must have dozed over the book. suddenly, i awoke and satupright, with a start. for a moment, i looked 'round, with a puzzledsense of something unusual. there was a misty look about the room,giving a curious softness to each table and chair and furnishing.gradually, the mistiness increased; growing, as it were, out ofnothing. then, slowly, a soft, white light began to glow in the room.the flames of the candles shone through it, palely. i looked from sideto side, and found that i could still see each piece of furniture; butin a strangely unreal way, more as though the ghost of each table andchair had taken the place of the solid article.gradually, as i looked, i saw them fade and fade; until, slowly, theyresolved into nothingness. now, i looked again at the candles. theyshone wanly, and, even as i watched, grew more unreal, and so vanished.the room was filled, now, with a soft, yet luminous, white twilight,like a gentle mist of light. beyond this, i could see nothing. even thewalls had vanished.presently, i became conscious that a faint, continuous sound, pulsedthrough the silence that wrapped me. i listened intently. it grew moredistinct, until it appeared to me that i harked to the breathings ofsome great sea. i cannot tell how long a space passed thus; but, after awhile, it seemed that i could see through the mistiness; and, slowly, ibecame aware that i was standing upon the shore of an immense and silentsea. this shore was smooth and long, vanishing to right and left of me,in extreme distances. in front, swam a still immensity of sleepingocean. at times, it seemed to me that i caught a faint glimmer of light,under its surface; but of this, i could not be sure. behind me, rose up,to an extraordinary height, gaunt, black cliffs.overhead, the sky was of a uniform cold grey color--the whole placebeing lit by a stupendous globe of pale fire, that swam a little abovethe far horizon, and shed a foamlike light above the quiet waters.beyond the gentle murmur of the sea, an intense stillness prevailed.for a long while, i stayed there, looking out across its strangeness.then, as i stared, it seemed that a bubble of white foam floated up outof the depths, and then, even now i know not how it was, i was lookingupon, nay, looking _into_ the face of her--aye! into her face--into hersoul; and she looked back at me, with such a commingling of joy andsadness, that i ran toward her, blindly; crying strangely to her, in avery agony of remembrance, of terror, and of hope, to come to me. yet,spite of my crying, she stayed out there upon the sea, and only shookher head, sorrowfully; but, in her eyes was the old earth-light oftenderness, that i had come to know, before all things, ere wewere parted."at her perverseness, i grew desperate, and essayed to wade out to her;yet, though i would, i could not. something, some invisible barrier,held me back, and i was fain to stay where i was, and cry out to her inthe fullness of my soul, 'o, my darling, my darling--' but could say nomore, for very intensity. and, at that, she came over, swiftly, andtouched me, and it was as though heaven had opened. yet, when i reachedout my hands to her, she put me from her with tenderly stern hands, andi was abashed--"the fragments[2](_the legible portions of the mutilated leaves_.)... through tears ... noise of eternity in my ears, we parted ... shewhom i love. o, my god ...!i was a great time dazed, and then i was alone in the blackness of thenight. i knew that i journeyed back, once more, to the known universe.presently, i emerged from that enormous darkness. i had come among thestars ... vast time ... the sun, far and remote.i entered into the gulf that separates our system from the outer suns.as i sped across the dividing dark, i watched, steadily, theever-growing brightness and size of our sun. once, i glanced back to thestars, and saw them shift, as it were, in my wake, against the mightybackground of night, so vast was the speed of my passing spirit.i drew nigher to our system, and now i could see the shine of jupiter.later, i distinguished the cold, blue gleam of the earthlight.... i hada moment of bewilderment. all about the sun there seemed to be bright,objects, moving in rapid orbits. inward, nigh to the savage glory of thesun, there circled two darting points of light, and, further off, thereflew a blue, shining speck, that i knew to be the earth. it circled thesun in a space that seemed to be no more than an earth-minute.... nearer with great speed. i saw the radiances of jupiter andsaturn, spinning, with incredible swiftness, in huge orbits. and ever idrew more nigh, and looked out upon this strange sight--the visiblecircling of the planets about the mother sun. it was as though time hadbeen annihilated for me; so that a year was no more to my unfleshedspirit, than is a moment to an earth-bound soul.the speed of the planets, appeared to increase; and, presently, i waswatching the sun, all ringed about with hair-like circles of different fire--the paths of the planets, hurtling at mighty speed, aboutthe central flame...."... the sun grew vast, as though it leapt to meet me.... and now i waswithin the circling of the outer planets, and flitting swiftly, towardthe place where the earth, glimmering through the blue splendor of itsorbit, as though a fiery mist, circled the sun at a monstrousspeed...." [3]_xv_the noise in the nightand now, i come to the strangest of all the strange happenings thathave befallen me in this house of mysteries. it occurred quitelately--within the month; and i have little doubt but that what i sawwas in reality the end of all things. however, to my story.i do not know how it is; but, up to the present, i have never been ableto write these things down, directly they happened. it is as though ihave to wait a time, recovering my just balance, and digesting--as itwere--the things i have heard or seen. no doubt, this is as it shouldbe; for, by waiting, i see the incidents more truly, and write of themin a calmer and more judicial frame of mind. this by the way.it is now the end of november. my story relates to what happened in thefirst week of the month.it was night, about eleven o'clock. pepper and i kept one anothercompany in the study--that great, old room of mine, where i read andwork. i was reading, curiously enough, the bible. i have begun, in theselater days, to take a growing interest in that great and ancient book.suddenly, a distinct tremor shook the house, and there came a faint anddistant, whirring buzz, that grew rapidly into a far, muffled screaming.it reminded me, in a queer, gigantic way, of the noise that a clockmakes, when the catch is released, and it is allowed to run down. thesound appeared to come from some remote height--somewhere up in thenight. there was no repetition of the shock. i looked across at pepper.he was sleeping peacefully.gradually, the whirring noise decreased, and there came a long silence.all at once, a glow lit up the end window, which protrudes far out fromthe side of the house, so that, from it, one may look both east andwest. i felt puzzled, and, after a moment's hesitation, walked acrossthe room, and pulled aside the blind. as i did so, i saw the sun rise,from behind the horizon. it rose with a steady, perceptible movement. icould see it travel upward. in a minute, it seemed, it had reached thetops of the trees, through which i had watched it. up, up--it was broaddaylight now. behind me, i was conscious of a sharp, mosquito-likebuzzing. i glanced 'round, and knew that it came from the clock. even asi looked, it marked off an hour. the minute hand was moving 'round thedial, faster than an ordinary second-hand. the hour hand moved quicklyfrom space to space. i had a numb sense of astonishment. a moment later,so it seemed, the two candles went out, almost together. i turnedswiftly back to the window; for i had seen the shadow of thewindow-frames, traveling along the floor toward me, as though a greatlamp had been carried up past the window.i saw now, that the sun had risen high into the heavens, and was stillvisibly moving. it passed above the house, with an extraordinary sailingkind of motion. as the window came into shadow, i saw anotherextraordinary thing. the fine-weather clouds were not passing, easily,across the sky--they were scampering, as though a hundred-mile-an-hourwind blew. as they passed, they changed their shapes a thousand times aminute, as though writhing with a strange life; and so were gone. and,presently, others came, and whisked away likewise.to the west, i saw the sun, drop with an incredible, smooth, swiftmotion. eastward, the shadows of every seen thing crept toward thecoming greyness. and the movement of the shadows was visible to me--astealthy, writhing creep of the shadows of the wind-stirred trees. itwas a strange sight.quickly, the room began to darken. the sun slid down to the horizon,and seemed, as it were, to disappear from my sight, almost with a jerk.through the greyness of the swift evening, i saw the silver crescent ofthe moon, falling out of the southern sky, toward the west. the eveningseemed to merge into an almost instant night. above me, the manyconstellations passed in a strange, 'noiseless' circling, westward. themoon fell through that last thousand fathoms of the night-gulf, andthere was only the starlight....about this time, the buzzing in the corner ceased; telling me that theclock had run down. a few minutes passed, and i saw the eastward skylighten. a grey, sullen morning spread through all the darkness, and hidthe march of the stars. overhead, there moved, with a heavy, everlastingrolling, a vast, seamless sky of grey clouds--a cloud-sky that wouldhave seemed motionless, through all the length of an ordinary earth-day.the sun was hidden from me; but, from moment to moment, the world wouldbrighten and darken, brighten and darken, beneath waves of subtle lightand shadow....the light shifted ever westward, and the night fell upon the earth. avast rain seemed to come with it, and a wind of a most extraordinaryloudness--as though the howling of a nightlong gale, were packed intothe space of no more than a minute.this noise passed, almost immediately, and the clouds broke; so that,once more, i could see the sky. the stars were flying westward, withastounding speed. it came to me now, for the first time, that, thoughthe noise of the wind had passed, yet a constant 'blurred' sound was inmy ears. now that i noticed it, i was aware that it had been with me allthe time. it was the world-noise.and then, even as i grasped at so much comprehension, there came theeastward light. no more than a few heartbeats, and the sun rose,swiftly. through the trees, i saw it, and then it was above the trees.up--up, it soared and all the world was light. it passed, with a swift,steady swing to its highest altitude, and fell thence, westward. i sawthe day roll visibly over my head. a few light clouds flitterednorthward, and vanished. the sun went down with one swift, clear plunge,and there was about me, for a few seconds, the darker growing grey ofthe gloaming.southward and westward, the moon was sinking rapidly. the night hadcome, already. a minute it seemed, and the moon fell those remainingfathoms of dark sky. another minute, or so, and the eastward sky glowedwith the coming dawn. the sun leapt upon me with a frighteningabruptness, and soared ever more swiftly toward the zenith. then,suddenly, a fresh thing came to my sight. a black thundercloud rushed upout of the south, and seemed to leap all the arc of the sky, in a singleinstant. as it came, i saw that its advancing edge flapped, like amonstrous black cloth in the heaven, twirling and undulating rapidly,with a horrid suggestiveness. in an instant, all the air was full ofrain, and a hundred lightning flashes seemed to flood downward, as itwere in one great shower. in the same second of time, the world-noisewas drowned in the roar of the wind, and then my ears ached, under thestunning impact of the thunder.and, in the midst of this storm, the night came; and then, within thespace of another minute, the storm had passed, and there was only theconstant 'blur' of the world-noise on my hearing. overhead, the starswere sliding quickly westward; and something, mayhaps the particularspeed to which they had attained, brought home to me, for the firsttime, a keen realization of the knowledge that it was the world thatrevolved. i seemed to see, suddenly, the world--a vast, darkmass--revolving visibly against the stars.the dawn and the sun seemed to come together, so greatly had the speedof the world-revolution increased. the sun drove up, in one long, steadycurve; passed its highest point, and swept down into the western sky,and disappeared. i was scarcely conscious of evening, so brief was it.then i was watching the flying constellations, and the westwardhastening moon. in but a space of seconds, so it seemed, it was slidingswiftly downward through the night-blue, and then was gone. and, almostdirectly, came the morning.and now there seemed to come a strange acceleration. the sun made oneclean, clear sweep through the sky, and disappeared behind the westwardhorizon, and the night came and went with a like haste.as the succeeding day, opened and closed upon the world, i was aware ofa sweat of snow, suddenly upon the earth. the night came, and, almostimmediately, the day. in the brief leap of the sun, i saw that the snowhad vanished; and then, once more, it was night.thus matters were; and, even after the many incredible things that ihave seen, i experienced all the time a most profound awe. to see thesun rise and set, within a space of time to be measured by seconds; towatch (after a little) the moon leap--a pale, and ever growing orb--upinto the night sky, and glide, with a strange swiftness, through thevast arc of blue; and, presently, to see the sun follow, springing outof the eastern sky, as though in chase; and then again the night, withthe swift and ghostly passing of starry constellations, was all too muchto view believingly. yet, so it was--the day slipping from dawn to dusk,and the night sliding swiftly into day, ever rapidly and more rapidly.the last three passages of the sun had shown me a snow-covered earth,which, at night, had seemed, for a few seconds, incredibly weird underthe fast-shifting light of the soaring and falling moon. now, however,for a little space, the sky was hidden, by a sea of swaying,leaden-white clouds, which lightened and blackened, alternately, withthe passage of day and night.the clouds rippled and vanished, and there was once more before me, thevision of the swiftly leaping sun, and nights that came and wentlike shadows.faster and faster, spun the world. and now each day and night wascompleted within the space of but a few seconds; and still the speedincreased.it was a little later, that i noticed that the sun had begun to havethe suspicion of a trail of fire behind it. this was due, evidently, tothe speed at which it, apparently, traversed the heavens. and, as thedays sped, each one quicker than the last, the sun began to assume theappearance of a vast, flaming comet[4] flaring across the sky at short,periodic intervals. at night, the moon presented, with much greatertruth, a comet-like aspect; a pale, and singularly clear, fast travelingshape of fire, trailing streaks of cold flame. the stars showed now,merely as fine hairs of fire against the dark.once, i turned from the window, and glanced at pepper. in the flash ofa day, i saw that he slept, quietly, and i moved once more tomy watching.the sun was now bursting up from the eastern horizon, like a stupendousrocket, seeming to occupy no more than a second or two in hurling fromeast to west. i could no longer perceive the passage of clouds acrossthe sky, which seemed to have darkened somewhat. the brief nights,appeared to have lost the proper darkness of night; so that the hair-likefire of the flying stars, showed but dimly. as the speed increased, thesun began to sway very slowly in the sky, from south to north, and then,slowly again, from north to south.so, amid a strange confusion of mind, the hours passed.all this while had pepper slept. presently, feeling lonely anddistraught, i called to him, softly; but he took no notice. again, icalled, raising my voice slightly; still he moved not. i walked over towhere he lay, and touched him with my foot, to rouse him. at the action,gentle though it was, he fell to pieces. that is what happened; heliterally and actually crumbled into a mouldering heap of bonesand dust.for the space of, perhaps a minute, i stared down at the shapelessheap, that had once been pepper. i stood, feeling stunned. what can havehappened? i asked myself; not at once grasping the grim significance ofthat little hill of ash. then, as i stirred the heap with my foot, itoccurred to me that this could only happen in a great space of time.years--and years.outside, the weaving, fluttering light held the world. inside, i stood,trying to understand what it meant--what that little pile of dust anddry bones, on the carpet, meant. but i could not think, coherently.i glanced away, 'round the room, and now, for the first time, noticedhow dusty and old the place looked. dust and dirt everywhere; piled inlittle heaps in the corners, and spread about upon the furniture. thevery carpet, itself, was invisible beneath a coating of the same, allpervading, material. as i walked, little clouds of the stuff rose upfrom under my footsteps, and assailed my nostrils, with a dry, bitterodor that made me wheeze, huskily.suddenly, as my glance fell again upon pepper's remains, i stood still,and gave voice to my confusion--questioning, aloud, whether the yearswere, indeed, passing; whether this, which i had taken to be a form ofvision, was, in truth, a reality. i paused. a new thought had struck me.quickly, but with steps which, for the first time, i noticed, tottered,i went across the room to the great pier-glass, and looked in. it wastoo covered with grime, to give back any reflection, and, with tremblinghands, i began to rub off the dirt. presently, i could see myself. thethought that had come to me, was confirmed. instead of the great, haleman, who scarcely looked fifty, i was looking at a bent, decrepit man,whose shoulders stooped, and whose face was wrinkled with the years of acentury. the hair--which a few short hours ago had been nearly coalblack--was now silvery white. only the eyes were bright. gradually, itraced, in that ancient man, a faint resemblance to my self ofother days.i turned away, and tottered to the window. i knew, now, that i was old,and the knowledge seemed to confirm my trembling walk. for a littlespace, i stared moodily out into the blurred vista of changefullandscape. even in that short time, a year passed, and, with a petulantgesture, i left the window. as i did so, i noticed that my hand shookwith the palsy of old age; and a short sob choked its way throughmy lips.for a little while, i paced, tremulously, between the window and thetable; my gaze wandering hither and thither, uneasily. how dilapidatedthe room was. everywhere lay the thick dust--thick, sleepy, and black.the fender was a shape of rust. the chains that held the brassclock-weights, had rusted through long ago, and now the weights lay onthe floor beneath; themselves two cones of verdigris.as i glanced about, it seemed to me that i could see the very furnitureof the room rotting and decaying before my eyes. nor was this fancy, onmy part; for, all at once, the bookshelf, along the sidewall, collapsed,with a cracking and rending of rotten wood, precipitating its contentsupon the floor, and filling the room with a smother of dusty atoms.how tired i felt. as i walked, it seemed that i could hear my dryjoints, creak and crack at every step. i wondered about my sister. wasshe dead, as well as pepper? all had happened so quickly and suddenly.this must be, indeed, the beginning of the end of all things! itoccurred to me, to go to look for her; but i felt too weary. and then,she had been so queer about these happenings, of late. of late! irepeated the words, and laughed, feebly--mirthlessly, as the realizationwas borne in upon me that i spoke of a time, half a century gone. half acentury! it might have been twice as long!i moved slowly to the window, and looked out once more across theworld. i can best describe the passage of day and night, at this period,as a sort of gigantic, ponderous flicker. moment by moment, theacceleration of time continued; so that, at nights now, i saw the moon,only as a swaying trail of palish fire, that varied from a mere line oflight to a nebulous path, and then dwindled again, disappearingperiodically.the flicker of the days and nights quickened. the days had grownperceptibly darker, and a queer quality of dusk lay, as it were, in theatmosphere. the nights were so much lighter, that the stars werescarcely to be seen, saving here and there an occasional hair-like lineof fire, that seemed to sway a little, with the moon.quicker, and ever quicker, ran the flicker of day and night; and,suddenly it seemed, i was aware that the flicker had died out, and,instead, there reigned a comparatively steady light, which was shed uponall the world, from an eternal river of flame that swung up and down,north and south, in stupendous, mighty swings.the sky was now grown very much darker, and there was in the blue of ita heavy gloom, as though a vast blackness peered through it upon theearth. yet, there was in it, also, a strange and awful clearness, andemptiness. periodically, i had glimpses of a ghostly track of fire thatswayed thin and darkly toward the sun-stream; vanished and reappeared.it was the scarcely visible moon-stream.looking out at the landscape, i was conscious again, of a blurring sortof 'flitter,' that came either from the light of the ponderous-swingingsun-stream, or was the result of the incredibly rapid changes of theearth's surface. and every few moments, so it seemed, the snow would liesuddenly upon the world, and vanish as abruptly, as though an invisiblegiant 'flitted' a white sheet off and on the earth.time fled, and the weariness that was mine, grew insupportable. iturned from the window, and walked once across the room, the heavy dustdeadening the sound of my footsteps. each step that i took, seemed agreater effort than the one before. an intolerable ache, knew me inevery joint and limb, as i trod my way, with a weary uncertainty.by the opposite wall, i came to a weak pause, and wondered, dimly, whatwas my intent. i looked to my left, and saw my old chair. the thought ofsitting in it brought a faint sense of comfort to my bewilderedwretchedness. yet, because i was so weary and old and tired, i wouldscarcely brace my mind to do anything but stand, and wish myself pastthose few yards. i rocked, as i stood. the floor, even, seemed a placefor rest; but the dust lay so thick and sleepy and black. i turned, witha great effort of will, and made toward my chair. i reached it, with agroan of thankfulness. i sat down.everything about me appeared to be growing dim. it was all so strangeand unthought of. last night, i was a comparatively strong, thoughelderly man; and now, only a few hours later--! i looked at the littledust-heap that had once been pepper. hours! and i laughed, a feeble,bitter laugh; a shrill, cackling laugh, that shocked my dimming senses.for a while, i must have dozed. then i opened my eyes, with a start.somewhere across the room, there had been a muffled noise of somethingfalling. i looked, and saw, vaguely, a cloud of dust hovering above apile of _debris_. nearer the door, something else tumbled, with a crash.it was one of the cupboards; but i was tired, and took little notice. iclosed my eyes, and sat there in a state of drowsy, semi-unconsciousness.once or twice--as though coming through thick mists--i heard noises,faintly. then i must have slept._xvi_the awakeningi awoke, with a start. for a moment, i wondered where i was. thenmemory came to me....the room was still lit with that strange light--half-sun, half-moon,light. i felt refreshed, and the tired, weary ache had left me. i wentslowly across to the window, and looked out. overhead, the river offlame drove up and down, north and south, in a dancing semi-circle offire. as a mighty sleigh in the loom of time it seemed--in a suddenfancy of mine--to be beating home the picks of the years. for, so vastlyhad the passage of time been accelerated, that there was no longer anysense of the sun passing from east to west. the only apparent movementwas the north and south beat of the sun-stream, that had become so swiftnow, as to be better described as a _quiver_.as i peered out, there came to me a sudden, inconsequent memory of thatlast journey among the outer worlds. i remembered the sudden vision thathad come to me, as i neared the solar system, of the fast whirlingplanets about the sun--as though the governing quality of time had beenheld in abeyance, and the machine of a universe allowed to run down aneternity, in a few moments or hours. the memory passed, along with a,but partially comprehended, suggestion that i had been permitted aglimpse into further time spaces. i stared out again, seemingly, at thequake of the sun-stream. the speed seemed to increase, even as i looked.several lifetimes came and went, as i watched.suddenly, it struck me, with a sort of grotesque seriousness, that iwas still alive. i thought of pepper, and wondered how it was that i hadnot followed his fate. he had reached the time of his dying, and hadpassed, probably through sheer length of years. and here was i, alive,hundreds of thousands of centuries after my rightful period of years.for, a time, i mused, absently. 'yesterday--' i stopped, suddenly.yesterday! there was no yesterday. the yesterday of which i spoke hadbeen swallowed up in the abyss of years, ages gone. i grew dazed withmuch thinking.presently, i turned from the window, and glanced 'round the room. itseemed different--strangely, utterly different. then, i knew what it wasthat made it appear so strange. it was bare: there was not a piece offurniture in the room; not even a solitary fitting of any sort.gradually, my amazement went, as i remembered, that this was but theinevitable end of that process of decay, which i had witnessedcommencing, before my sleep. thousands of years! millions of years!over the floor was spread a deep layer of dust, that reached half wayup to the window-seat. it had grown immeasurably, whilst i slept; andrepresented the dust of untold ages. undoubtedly, atoms of the old,decayed furniture helped to swell its bulk; and, somewhere among it all,mouldered the long-ago-dead pepper.all at once, it occurred to me, that i had no recollection of wadingknee-deep through all that dust, after i awoke. true, an incredible ageof years had passed, since i approached the window; but that wasevidently as nothing, compared with the countless spaces of time that, iconceived, had vanished whilst i was sleeping. i remembered now, that ihad fallen asleep, sitting in my old chair. had it gone ...? i glancedtoward where it had stood. of course, there was no chair to be seen. icould not satisfy myself, whether it had disappeared, after my waking,or before. if it had mouldered under me, surely, i should have beenwaked by the collapse. then i remembered that the thick dust, whichcovered the floor, would have been sufficient to soften my fall; so thatit was quite possible, i had slept upon the dust for a million yearsor more.as these thoughts wandered through my brain, i glanced again, casually,to where the chair had stood. then, for the first time, i noticed thatthere were no marks, in the dust, of my footprints, between it and thewindow. but then, ages of years had passed, since i had awaked--tens ofthousands of years!my look rested thoughtfully, again upon the place where once had stoodmy chair. suddenly, i passed from abstraction to intentness; for there,in its standing place, i made out a long undulation, rounded off withthe heavy dust. yet it was not so much hidden, but that i could tellwhat had caused it. i knew--and shivered at the knowledge--that it was ahuman body, ages-dead, lying there, beneath the place where i had slept.it was lying on its right side, its back turned toward me. i could makeout and trace each curve and outline, softened, and moulded, as it were,in the black dust. in a vague sort of way, i tried to account for itspresence there. slowly, i began to grow bewildered, as the thought cameto me that it lay just about where i must have fallen when the chaircollapsed.gradually, an idea began to form itself within my brain; a thought thatshook my spirit. it seemed hideous and insupportable; yet it grew uponme, steadily, until it became a conviction. the body under that coating,that shroud of dust, was neither more nor less than my own dead shell. idid not attempt to prove it. i knew it now, and wondered i had not knownit all along. i was a bodiless thing.awhile, i stood, trying to adjust my thoughts to this new problem. intime--how many thousands of years, i know not--i attained to some degreeof quietude--sufficient to enable me to pay attention to what wastranspiring around me.now, i saw that the elongated mound had sunk, collapsed, level with therest of the spreading dust. and fresh atoms, impalpable, had settledabove that mixture of grave-powder, which the aeons had ground. a longwhile, i stood, turned from the window. gradually, i grew morecollected, while the world slipped across the centuries into the future.presently, i began a survey of the room. now, i saw that time wasbeginning its destructive work, even on this strange old building. thatit had stood through all the years was, it seemed to me, proof that itwas something different from any other house. i do not think, somehow,that i had thought of its decaying. though, why, i could not have said.it was not until i had meditated upon the matter, for some considerabletime, that i fully realized that the extraordinary space of time throughwhich it had stood, was sufficient to have utterly pulverized the verystones of which it was built, had they been taken from any earthlyquarry. yes, it was undoubtedly mouldering now. all the plaster had gonefrom the walls; even as the woodwork of the room had gone, manyages before.while i stood, in contemplation, a piece of glass, from one of thesmall, diamond-shaped panes, dropped, with a dull tap, amid the dustupon the sill behind me, and crumbled into a little heap of powder. as iturned from contemplating it, i saw light between a couple of the stonesthat formed the outer wall. evidently, the mortar was falling away....after awhile, i turned once more to the window, and peered out. idiscovered, now, that the speed of time had become enormous. the lateralquiver of the sun-stream, had grown so swift as to cause the dancingsemi-circle of flame to merge into, and disappear in, a sheet of firethat covered half the southern sky from east to west.from the sky, i glanced down to the gardens. they were just a blur of apalish, dirty green. i had a feeling that they stood higher, than in theold days; a feeling that they were nearer my window, as though they hadrisen, bodily. yet, they were still a long way below me; for the rock,over the mouth of the pit, on which this house stands, arches up to agreat height.it was later, that i noticed a change in the constant color of thegardens. the pale, dirty green was growing ever paler and paler, towardwhite. at last, after a great space, they became greyish-white, andstayed thus for a very long time. finally, however, the greyness beganto fade, even as had the green, into a dead white. and this remained,constant and unchanged. and by this i knew that, at last, snow lay uponall the northern world.and so, by millions of years, time winged onward through eternity, tothe end--the end, of which, in the old-earth days, i had thoughtremotely, and in hazily speculative fashion. and now, it was approachingin a manner of which none had ever dreamed.i recollect that, about this time, i began to have a lively, thoughmorbid, curiosity, as to what would happen when the end came--but iseemed strangely without imaginings.all this while, the steady process of decay was continuing. the fewremaining pieces of glass, had long ago vanished; and, every now andthen, a soft thud, and a little cloud of rising dust, would tell of somefragment of fallen mortar or stone.i looked up again, to the fiery sheet that quaked in the heavens aboveme and far down into the southern sky. as i looked, the impression wasborne in upon me, that it had lost some of its first brilliancy--that itwas duller, deeper hued.i glanced down, once more, to the blurred white of the worldscape.sometimes, my look returned to the burning sheet of dulling flame, thatwas, and yet hid, the sun. at times, i glanced behind me, into thegrowing dusk of the great, silent room, with its aeon-carpet ofsleeping dust....so, i watched through the fleeting ages, lost in soul-wearing thoughtsand wonderings, and possessed with a new weariness._xvii_the slowing rotationit might have been a million years later, that i perceived, beyondpossibility of doubt, that the fiery sheet that lit the world, wasindeed darkening.another vast space went by, and the whole enormous flame had sunk to adeep, copper color. gradually, it darkened, from copper to copper-red,and from this, at times, to a deep, heavy, purplish tint, with, in it, astrange loom of blood.although the light was decreasing, i could perceive no diminishment inthe apparent speed of the sun. it still spread itself in that dazzlingveil of speed.the world, so much of it as i could see, had assumed a dreadful shadeof gloom, as though, in very deed, the last day of the worldsapproached.the sun was dying; of that there could be little doubt; and still theearth whirled onward, through space and all the aeons. at this time, iremember, an extraordinary sense of bewilderment took me. i foundmyself, later, wandering, mentally, amid an odd chaos of fragmentarymodern theories and the old biblical story of the world's ending.then, for the first time, there flashed across me, the memory that thesun, with its system of planets, was, and had been, traveling throughspace at an incredible speed. abruptly, the question rose--_where?_ fora very great time, i pondered this matter; but, finally, with a certainsense of the futility of my puzzlings, i let my thoughts wander to otherthings. i grew to wondering, how much longer the house would stand.also, i queried, to myself, whether i should be doomed to stay,bodiless, upon the earth, through the dark-time that i knew was coming.from these thoughts, i fell again to speculations upon the possibledirection of the sun's journey through space.... and so another greatwhile passed.gradually, as time fled, i began to feel the chill of a great winter.then, i remembered that, with the sun dying, the cold must be,necessarily, extraordinarily intense. slowly, slowly, as the aeonsslipped into eternity, the earth sank into a heavier and redder gloom.the dull flame in the firmament took on a deeper tint, very somberand turbid.then, at last, it was borne upon me that there was a change. the fiery,gloomy curtain of flame that hung quaking overhead, and down away intothe southern sky, began to thin and contract; and, in it, as one seesthe fast vibrations of a jarred harp-string, i saw once more thesun-stream quivering, giddily, north and south.slowly, the likeness to a sheet of fire, disappeared, and i saw,plainly, the slowing beat of the sun-stream. yet, even then, the speedof its swing was inconceivably swift. and all the time, the brightnessof the fiery arc grew ever duller. underneath, the world loomeddimly--an indistinct, ghostly region.overhead, the river of flame swayed slower, and even slower; until, atlast, it swung to the north and south in great, ponderous beats, thatlasted through seconds. a long space went by, and now each sway of thegreat belt lasted nigh a minute; so that, after a great while, i ceasedto distinguish it as a visible movement; and the streaming fire ran in asteady river of dull flame, across the deadly-looking sky.an indefinite period passed, and it seemed that the arc of fire becameless sharply defined. it appeared to me to grow more attenuated, and ithought blackish streaks showed, occasionally. presently, as i watched,the smooth onward-flow ceased; and i was able to perceive that therecame a momentary, but regular, darkening of the world. this grew until,once more, night descended, in short, but periodic, intervals upon thewearying earth.longer and longer became the nights, and the days equaled them; sothat, at last, the day and the night grew to the duration of seconds inlength, and the sun showed, once more, like an almost invisible,coppery-red  ball, within the glowing mistiness of its flight.corresponding to the dark lines, showing at times in its trail, therewere now distinctly to be seen on the half-visible sun itself, great,dark belts.year after year flashed into the past, and the days and nights spreadinto minutes. the sun had ceased to have the appearance of a tail; andnow rose and set--a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue; inparts ringed with blood-red bands; in others, with the dusky ones, thati have already mentioned. these circles--both red and black--were ofvarying thicknesses. for a time, i was at a loss to account for theirpresence. then it occurred to me, that it was scarcely likely that thesun would cool evenly all over; and that these markings were due,probably, to differences in temperature of the various areas; the redrepresenting those parts where the heat was still fervent, and the blackthose portions which were already comparatively cool.it struck me, as a peculiar thing, that the sun should cool in evenlydefined rings; until i remembered that, possibly, they were but isolatedpatches, to which the enormous rotatory speed of the sun had imparted abelt-like appearance. the sun, itself, was very much greater than the suni had known in the old-world days; and, from this, i argued that it wasconsiderably nearer.at nights, the moon[6] still showed; but small and remote; and thelight she reflected was so dull and weak that she seemed little morethan the small, dim ghost of the olden moon, that i had known.gradually, the days and nights lengthened out, until they equaled aspace somewhat less than one of the old-earth hours; the sun rising andsetting like a great, ruddy bronze disk, crossed with ink-black bars.about this time, i found myself, able once more, to see the gardens,with clearness. for the world had now grown very still, and changeless.yet, i am not correct in saying, 'gardens'; for there were nogardens--nothing that i knew or recognized. in place thereof, i lookedout upon a vast plain, stretching away into distance. a little to myleft, there was a low range of hills. everywhere, there was a uniform,white covering of snow, in places rising into hummocks and ridges.it was only now, that i recognized how really great had been thesnowfall. in places it was vastly deep, as was witnessed by a great,upleaping, wave-shaped hill, away to my right; though it is notimpossible, that this was due, in part, to some rise in the surface ofthe ground. strangely enough, the range of low hills to myleft--already mentioned--was not entirely covered with the universalsnow; instead, i could see their bare, dark sides showing in severalplaces. and everywhere and always there reigned an incredibledeath-silence and desolation. the immutable, awful quiet of adying world.all this time, the days and nights were lengthening, perceptibly.already, each day occupied, maybe, some two hours from dawn to dusk. atnight, i had been surprised to find that there were very few starsoverhead, and these small, though of an extraordinary brightness; whichi attributed to the peculiar, but clear, blackness of the nighttime.away to the north, i could discern a nebulous sort of mistiness; notunlike, in appearance, a small portion of the milky way. it might havebeen an extremely remote star-cluster; or--the thought came to mesuddenly--perhaps it was the sidereal universe that i had known, and nowleft far behind, forever--a small, dimly glowing mist of stars, far inthe depths of space.still, the days and nights lengthened, slowly. each time, the sun roseduller than it had set. and the dark belts increased in breadth.about this time, there happened a fresh thing. the sun, earth, and skywere suddenly darkened, and, apparently, blotted out for a brief space.i had a sense, a certain awareness (i could learn little by sight), thatthe earth was enduring a very great fall of snow. then, in an instant,the veil that had obscured everything, vanished, and i looked out, oncemore. a marvelous sight met my gaze. the hollow in which this house,with its gardens, stands, was brimmed with snow.[7] it lipped over thesill of my window. everywhere, it lay, a great level stretch of white,which caught and reflected, gloomily, the somber coppery glows of thedying sun. the world had become a shadowless plain, from horizonto horizon.i glanced up at the sun. it shone with an extraordinary, dullclearness. i saw it, now, as one who, until then, had seen it, onlythrough a partially obscuring medium. all about it, the sky had becomeblack, with a clear, deep blackness, frightful in its nearness, and itsunmeasured deep, and its utter unfriendliness. for a great time, ilooked into it, newly, and shaken and fearful. it was so near. had ibeen a child, i might have expressed some of my sensation and distress,by saying that the sky had lost its roof.later, i turned, and peered about me, into the room. everywhere, it wascovered with a thin shroud of the all-pervading white. i could see itbut dimly, by reason of the somber light that now lit the world. itappeared to cling to the ruined walls; and the thick, soft dust of theyears, that covered the floor knee-deep, was nowhere visible. the snowmust have blown in through the open framework of the windows. yet, in noplace had it drifted; but lay everywhere about the great, old room,smooth and level. moreover, there had been no wind these many thousandyears. but there was the snow,[8] as i have told.and all the earth was silent. and there was a cold, such as no livingman can ever have known.the earth was now illuminated, by day, with a most doleful light,beyond my power to describe. it seemed as though i looked at the greatplain, through the medium of a bronze-tinted sea.it was evident that the earth's rotatory movement was departing,steadily.the end came, all at once. the night had been the longest yet; andwhen the dying sun showed, at last, above the world's edge, i had grownso wearied of the dark, that i greeted it as a friend. it rose steadily,until about twenty degrees above the horizon. then, it stopped suddenly,and, after a strange retrograde movement, hung motionless--a greatshield in the sky[9]. only the circular rim of the sun showedbright--only this, and one thin streak of light near the equator.gradually, even this thread of light died out; and now, all that wasleft of our great and glorious sun, was a vast dead disk, rimmed with athin circle of bronze-red light._xviii_the green starthe world was held in a savage gloom--cold and intolerable. outside,all was quiet--quiet! from the dark room behind me, came the occasional,soft thud[10] of falling matter--fragments of rotting stone. so timepassed, and night grasped the world, wrapping it in wrappings ofimpenetrable blackness.there was no night-sky, as we know it. even the few straggling starshad vanished, conclusively. i might have been in a shuttered room,without a light; for all that i could see. only, in the impalpablenessof gloom, opposite, burnt that vast, encircling hair of dull fire.beyond this, there was no ray in all the vastitude of night thatsurrounded me; save that, far in the north, that soft, mistlike glowstill shone.silently, years moved on. what period of time passed, i shall neverknow. it seemed to me, waiting there, that eternities came and went,stealthily; and still i watched. i could see only the glow of the sun'sedge, at times; for now, it had commenced to come and go--lighting up awhile, and again becoming extinguished.all at once, during one of these periods of life, a sudden flame cutacross the night--a quick glare that lit up the dead earth, shortly;giving me a glimpse of its flat lonesomeness. the light appeared to comefrom the sun--shooting out from somewhere near its center, diagonally. amoment, i gazed, startled. then the leaping flame sank, and the gloomfell again. but now it was not so dark; and the sun was belted by a thinline of vivid, white light. i stared, intently. had a volcano broken outon the sun? yet, i negatived the thought, as soon as formed. i felt thatthe light had been far too intensely white, and large, for such a cause.another idea there was, that suggested itself to me. it was, that oneof the inner planets had fallen into the sun--becoming incandescent,under that impact. this theory appealed to me, as being more plausible,and accounting more satisfactorily for the extraordinary size andbrilliance of the blaze, that had lit up the dead world, sounexpectedly.full of interest and emotion, i stared, across the darkness, at thatline of white fire, cutting the night. one thing it told to me,unmistakably: the sun was yet rotating at an enormous speed.[11] thus, iknew that the years were still fleeting at an incalculable rate; thoughso far as the earth was concerned, life, and light, and time, werethings belonging to a period lost in the long gone ages.after that one burst of flame, the light had shown, only as anencircling band of bright fire. now, however, as i watched, it beganslowly to sink into a ruddy tint, and, later, to a dark, copper-redcolor; much as the sun had done. presently, it sank to a deeper hue;and, in a still further space of time, it began to fluctuate; havingperiods of glowing, and anon, dying. thus, after a great while, itdisappeared.long before this, the smoldering edge of the sun had deadened intoblackness. and so, in that supremely future time, the world, dark andintensely silent, rode on its gloomy orbit around the ponderous mass ofthe dead sun.my thoughts, at this period, can be scarcely described. at first, theywere chaotic and wanting in coherence. but, later, as the ages came andwent, my soul seemed to imbibe the very essence of the oppressivesolitude and dreariness, that held the earth.with this feeling, there came a wonderful clearness of thought, and irealized, despairingly, that the world might wander for ever, throughthat enormous night. for a while, the unwholesome idea filled me, with asensation of overbearing desolation; so that i could have cried like achild. in time, however, this feeling grew, almost insensibly, less, andan unreasoning hope possessed me. patiently, i waited.from time to time, the noise of dropping particles, behind in the room,came dully to my ears. once, i heard a loud crash, and turned,instinctively, to look; forgetting, for the moment, the impenetrablenight in which every detail was submerged. in a while, my gaze soughtthe heavens; turning, unconsciously, toward the north. yes, the nebulousglow still showed. indeed, i could have almost imagined that it lookedsomewhat plainer. for a long time, i kept my gaze fixed upon it;feeling, in my lonely soul, that its soft haze was, in some way, a tiewith the past. strange, the trifles from which one can suck comfort! andyet, had i but known--but i shall come to that in its proper time.for a very long space, i watched, without experiencing any of thedesire for sleep, that would so soon have visited me in the old-earthdays. how i should have welcomed it; if only to have passed the time,away from my perplexities and thoughts.several times, the comfortless sound of some great piece of masonryfalling, disturbed my meditations; and, once, it seemed i could hearwhispering in the room, behind me. yet it was utterly useless to try tosee anything. such blackness, as existed, scarcely can be conceived. itwas palpable, and hideously brutal to the sense; as though somethingdead, pressed up against me--something soft, and icily cold.under all this, there grew up within my mind, a great and overwhelmingdistress of uneasiness, that left me, but to drop me into anuncomfortable brooding. i felt that i must fight against it; and,presently, hoping to distract my thoughts, i turned to the window, andlooked up toward the north, in search of the nebulous whiteness, which,still, i believed to be the far and misty glowing of the universe we hadleft. even as i raised my eyes, i was thrilled with a feeling of wonder;for, now, the hazy light had resolved into a single, great star, ofvivid green.as i stared, astonished, the thought flashed into my mind; that theearth must be traveling toward the star; not away, as i had imagined.next, that it could not be the universe the earth had left; but,possibly, an outlying star, belonging to some vast star-cluster, hiddenin the enormous depths of space. with a sense of commingled awe andcuriosity, i watched it, wondering what new thing was to be revealedto me.for a while, vague thoughts and speculations occupied me, during whichmy gaze dwelt insatiably upon that one spot of light, in the otherwisepitlike darkness. hope grew up within me, banishing the oppression ofdespair, that had seemed to stifle me. wherever the earth was traveling,it was, at least, going once more toward the realms of light. light! onemust spend an eternity wrapped in soundless night, to understand thefull horror of being without it.slowly, but surely, the star grew upon my vision, until, in time, itshone as brightly as had the planet jupiter, in the old-earth days. withincreased size, its color became more impressive; reminding me of a hugeemerald, scintillating rays of fire across the world.years fled away in silence, and the green star grew into a great splashof flame in the sky. a little later, i saw a thing that filled me withamazement. it was the ghostly outline of a vast crescent, in the night;a gigantic new moon, seeming to be growing out of the surrounding gloom.utterly bemused, i stared at it. it appeared to be quiteclose--comparatively; and i puzzled to understand how the earth had comeso near to it, without my having seen it before.the light, thrown by the star, grew stronger; and, presently, i wasaware that it was possible to see the earthscape again; thoughindistinctly. awhile, i stared, trying to make out whether i coulddistinguish any detail of the world's surface, but i found the lightinsufficient. in a little, i gave up the attempt, and glanced once moretoward the star. even in the short space, that my attention had beendiverted, it had increased considerably, and seemed now, to mybewildered sight, about a quarter of the size of the full moon. thelight it threw, was extraordinarily powerful; yet its color was soabominably unfamiliar, that such of the world as i could see, showedunreal; more as though i looked out upon a landscape of shadow, thanaught else.all this time, the great crescent was increasing in brightness, andbegan, now, to shine with a perceptible shade of green. steadily, thestar increased in size and brilliancy, until it showed, fully as largeas half a full moon; and, as it grew greater and brighter, so did thevast crescent throw out more and more light, though of an ever deepeninghue of green. under the combined blaze of their radiances, thewilderness that stretched before me, became steadily more visible. soon,i seemed able to stare across the whole world, which now appeared,beneath the strange light, terrible in its cold and awful, flatdreariness.it was a little later, that my attention was drawn to the fact, thatthe great star of green flame, was slowly sinking out of the north,toward the east. at first, i could scarcely believe that i saw aright;but soon there could be no doubt that it was so. gradually, it sank,and, as it fell, the vast crescent of glowing green, began to dwindleand dwindle, until it became a mere arc of light, against the livid sky. later it vanished, disappearing in the self-same spot fromwhich i had seen it slowly emerge.by this time, the star had come to within some thirty degrees of thehidden horizon. in size it could now have rivaled the moon at its full;though, even yet, i could not distinguish its disk. this fact led me toconceive that it was, still, an extraordinary distance away; and, thisbeing so, i knew that its size must be huge, beyond the conception ofman to understand or imagine.suddenly, as i watched, the lower edge of the star vanished--cut by astraight, dark line. a minute--or a century--passed, and it dippedlower, until the half of it had disappeared from sight. far away out onthe great plain, i saw a monstrous shadow blotting it out, and advancingswiftly. only a third of the star was visible now. then, like a flash,the solution of this extraordinary phenomenon revealed itself to me. thestar was sinking behind the enormous mass of the dead sun. or rather,the sun--obedient to its attraction--was rising toward it,[12] with theearth following in its trail. as these thoughts expanded in my mind, thestar vanished; being completely hidden by the tremendous bulk of thesun. over the earth there fell, once more, the brooding night.with the darkness, came an intolerable feeling of loneliness and dread.for the first time, i thought of the pit, and its inmates. after that,there rose in my memory the still more terrible thing, that had hauntedthe shores of the sea of sleep, and lurked in the shadows of this oldbuilding. where were they? i wondered--and shivered with miserablethoughts. for a time, fear held me, and i prayed, wildly andincoherently, for some ray of light with which to dispel the coldblackness that enveloped the world.how long i waited, it is impossible to say--certainly for a very greatperiod. then, all at once, i saw a loom of light shine out ahead.gradually, it became more distinct. suddenly, a ray of vivid green,flashed across the darkness. at the same moment, i saw a thin line oflivid flame, far in the night. an instant, it seemed, and it had growninto a great clot of fire; beneath which, the world lay bathed in ablaze of emerald green light. steadily it grew, until, presently, thewhole of the green star had come into sight again. but now, it could bescarcely called a star; for it had increased to vast proportions, beingincomparably greater than the sun had been in the olden time."then, as i stared, i became aware that i could see the edge of thelifeless sun, glowing like a great crescent-moon. slowly, its lightedsurface, broadened out to me, until half of its diameter was visible;and the star began to drop away on my right. time passed, and the earthmoved on, slowly traversing the tremendous face of the dead sun." [13]gradually, as the earth traveled forward, the star fell still more tothe right; until, at last, it shone on the back of the house, sending aflood of broken rays, in through the skeleton-like walls. glancingupward, i saw that much of the ceiling had vanished, enabling me to seethat the upper storeys were even more decayed. the roof had, evidently,gone entirely; and i could see the green effulgence of the starlightshining in, slantingly._xix_the end of the solar systemfrom the abutment, where once had been the windows, through which i hadwatched that first, fatal dawn, i could see that the sun was hugelygreater, than it had been, when first the star lit the world. so greatwas it, that its lower edge seemed almost to touch the far horizon. evenas i watched, i imagined that it drew closer. the radiance of green thatlit the frozen earth, grew steadily brighter.thus, for a long space, things were. then, on a sudden, i saw that thesun was changing shape, and growing smaller, just as the moon would havedone in past time. in a while, only a third of the illuminated part wasturned toward the earth. the star bore away on the left.gradually, as the world moved on, the star shone upon the front of thehouse, once more; while the sun showed, only as a great bow of greenfire. an instant, it seemed, and the sun had vanished. the star wasstill fully visible. then the earth moved into the black shadow of thesun, and all was night--night, black, starless, and intolerable.filled with tumultuous thoughts, i watched across the night--waiting.years, it may have been, and then, in the dark house behind me, theclotted stillness of the world was broken. i seemed to hear a softpadding of many feet, and a faint, inarticulate whisper of sound, grewon my sense. i looked 'round into the blackness, and saw a multitude ofeyes. as i stared, they increased, and appeared to come toward me. foran instant, i stood, unable to move. then a hideous swine-noise[14] roseup into the night; and, at that, i leapt from the window, out on to thefrozen world. i have a confused notion of having run awhile; and, afterthat, i just waited--waited. several times, i heard shrieks; but alwaysas though from a distance. except for these sounds, i had no idea of thewhereabouts of the house. time moved onward. i was conscious of little,save a sensation of cold and hopelessness and fear.an age, it seemed, and there came a glow, that told of the cominglight. it grew, tardily. then--with a loom of unearthly glory--the firstray from the green star, struck over the edge of the dark sun, and litthe world. it fell upon a great, ruined structure, some two hundredyards away. it was the house. staring, i saw a fearsome sight--over itswalls crawled a legion of unholy things, almost covering the oldbuilding, from tottering towers to base. i could see them, plainly; theywere the swine-creatures.the world moved out into the light of the star, and i saw that, now, itseemed to stretch across a quarter of the heavens. the glory of itslivid light was so tremendous, that it appeared to fill the sky withquivering flames. then, i saw the sun. it was so close that half of itsdiameter lay below the horizon; and, as the world circled across itsface, it seemed to tower right up into the sky, a stupendous dome ofemerald  fire. from time to time, i glanced toward the house; butthe swine-things seemed unaware of my proximity.years appeared to pass, slowly. the earth had almost reached the centerof the sun's disk. the light from the green _sun_--as now it must becalled--shone through the interstices, that gapped the mouldered wallsof the old house, giving them the appearance of being wrapped in greenflames. the swine-creatures still crawled about the walls.suddenly, there rose a loud roar of swine-voices, and, up from thecenter of the roofless house, shot a vast column of blood-red flame. isaw the little, twisted towers and turrets flash into fire; yet stillpreserving their twisted crookedness. the beams of the green sun, beatupon the house, and intermingled with its lurid glows; so that itappeared a blazing furnace of red and green fire.fascinated, i watched, until an overwhelming sense of coming danger,drew my attention. i glanced up, and, at once, it was borne upon me,that the sun was closer; so close, in fact, that it seemed to overhangthe world. then--i know not how--i was caught up into strangeheights--floating like a bubble in the awful effulgence.far below me, i saw the earth, with the burning house leaping into anever growing mountain of flame, 'round about it, the ground appeared tobe glowing; and, in places, heavy wreaths of yellow smoke ascended fromthe earth. it seemed as though the world were becoming ignited from thatone plague-spot of fire. faintly, i could see the swine-things. theyappeared quite unharmed. then the ground seemed to cave in, suddenly,and the house, with its load of foul creatures, disappeared into thedepths of the earth, sending a strange, blood  cloud into theheights. i remembered the hell pit under the house.in a while, i looked 'round. the huge bulk of the sun, rose high aboveme. the distance between it and the earth, grew rapidly less. suddenly,the earth appeared to shoot forward. in a moment, it had traversed thespace between it and the sun. i heard no sound; but, out from the sun'sface, gushed an ever-growing tongue of dazzling flame. it seemed toleap, almost to the distant green sun--shearing through the emeraldlight, a very cataract of blinding fire. it reached its limit, and sank;and, on the sun, glowed a vast splash of burning white--the grave ofthe earth.the sun was very close to me, now. presently, i found that i was risinghigher; until, at last, i rode above it, in the emptiness. the green sunwas now so huge that its breadth seemed to fill up all the sky, ahead. ilooked down, and noted that the sun was passing directly beneath me.a year may have gone by--or a century--and i was left, suspended,alone. the sun showed far in front--a black, circular mass, against themolten splendor of the great, green orb. near one edge, i observed thata lurid glow had appeared, marking the place where the earth had fallen.by this, i knew that the long-dead sun was still revolving, though withgreat slowness.afar to my right, i seemed to catch, at times, a faint glow of whitishlight. for a great time, i was uncertain whether to put this down tofancy or not. thus, for a while, i stared, with fresh wonderings; until,at last, i knew that it was no imaginary thing; but a reality. it grewbrighter; and, presently, there slid out of the green, a pale globe ofsoftest white. it came nearer, and i saw that it was apparentlysurrounded by a robe of gently glowing clouds. time passed....i glanced toward the diminishing sun. it showed, only as a dark blot onthe face of the green sun. as i watched, i saw it grow smaller,steadily, as though rushing toward the superior orb, at an immensespeed. intently, i stared. what would happen? i was conscious ofextraordinary emotions, as i realized that it would strike the greensun. it grew no bigger than a pea, and i looked, with my whole soul, towitness the final end of our system--that system which had borne theworld through so many aeons, with its multitudinous sorrows andjoys; and now--suddenly, something crossed my vision, cutting from sight all vestigeof the spectacle i watched with such soul-interest. what happened to thedead sun, i did not see; but i have no reason--in the light of thatwhich i saw afterward--to disbelieve that it fell into the strange fireof the green sun, and so perished.and then, suddenly, an extraordinary question rose in my mind, whetherthis stupendous globe of green fire might not be the vast centralsun--the great sun, 'round which our universe and countless othersrevolve. i felt confused. i thought of the probable end of the dead sun,and another suggestion came, dumbly--do the dead stars make the greensun their grave? the idea appealed to me with no sense of grotesqueness;but rather as something both possible and probable._xx_the celestial globesfor a while, many thoughts crowded my mind, so that i was unable to doaught, save stare, blindly, before me. i seemed whelmed in a sea ofdoubt and wonder and sorrowful remembrance.it was later, that i came out of my bewilderment. i looked about,dazedly. thus, i saw so extraordinary a sight that, for a while, i couldscarcely believe i was not still wrapped in the visionary tumult of myown thoughts. out of the reigning green, had grown a boundless river ofsoftly shimmering globes--each one enfolded in a wondrous fleece of purecloud. they reached, both above and below me, to an unknown distance;and, not only hid the shining of the green sun; but supplied, in placethereof, a tender glow of light, that suffused itself around me, likeunto nothing i have ever seen, before or since.in a little, i noticed that there was about these spheres, a sort oftransparency, almost as though they were formed of clouded crystal,within which burned a radiance--gentle and subdued. they moved on, pastme, continually, floating onward at no great speed; but rather asthough they had eternity before them. a great while, i watched, andcould perceive no end to them. at times, i seemed to distinguish faces,amid the cloudiness; but strangely indistinct, as though partly real,and partly formed of the mistiness through which they showed.for a long time, i waited, passively, with a sense of growing content.i had no longer that feeling of unutterable loneliness; but felt,rather, that i was less alone, than i had been for kalpas of years. thisfeeling of contentment, increased, so that i would have been satisfiedto float in company with those celestial globules, forever.ages slipped by, and i saw the shadowy faces, with increased frequency,also with greater plainness. whether this was due to my soul havingbecome more attuned to its surroundings, i cannot tell--probably it wasso. but, however this may be, i am assured now, only of the fact that ibecame steadily more conscious of a new mystery about me, telling methat i had, indeed, penetrated within the borderland of someunthought-of region--some subtle, intangible place, or form, ofexistence.the enormous stream of luminous spheres continued to pass me, at anunvarying rate--countless millions; and still they came, showing nosigns of ending, nor even diminishing.then, as i was borne, silently, upon the unbuoying ether, i felt asudden, irresistible, forward movement, toward one of the passingglobes. an instant, and i was beside it. then, i slid through, into theinterior, without experiencing the least resistance, of any description.for a short while, i could see nothing; and waited, curiously.all at once, i became aware that a sound broke the inconceivablestillness. it was like the murmur of a great sea at calm--a seabreathing in its sleep. gradually, the mist that obscured my sight,began to thin away; and so, in time, my vision dwelt once again upon thesilent surface of the sea of sleep.for a little, i gazed, and could scarcely believe i saw aright. iglanced 'round. there was the great globe of pale fire, swimming, as ihad seen it before, a short distance above the dim horizon. to my left,far across the sea, i discovered, presently, a faint line, as of thinhaze, which i guessed to be the shore, where my love and i had met,during those wonderful periods of soul-wandering, that had been grantedto me in the old earth days.another, a troubled, memory came to me--of the formless thing that hadhaunted the shores of the sea of sleep. the guardian of that silent,echoless place. these, and other, details, i remembered, and knew,without doubt that i was looking out upon that same sea. with theassurance, i was filled with an overwhelming feeling of surprise, andjoy, and shaken expectancy, conceiving it possible that i was about tosee my love, again. intently, i gazed around; but could catch no sightof her. at that, for a little, i felt hopeless. fervently, i prayed, andever peered, anxiously.... how still was the sea!down, far beneath me, i could see the many trails of changeful fire,that had drawn my attention, formerly. vaguely, i wondered what causedthem; also, i remembered that i had intended to ask my dear one aboutthem, as well as many other matters--and i had been forced to leave her,before the half that i had wished to say, was said.my thoughts came back with a leap. i was conscious that something hadtouched me. i turned quickly. god, thou wert indeed gracious--it wasshe! she looked up into my eyes, with an eager longing, and i lookeddown to her, with all my soul. i should like to have held her; but theglorious purity of her face, kept me afar. then, out of the windingmist, she put her dear arms. her whisper came to me, soft as the rustleof a passing cloud. 'dearest!' she said. that was all; but i had heard,and, in a moment i held her to me--as i prayed--forever.in a little, she spoke of many things, and i listened. willingly, wouldi have done so through all the ages that are to come. at times, iwhispered back, and my whispers brought to her spirit face, once more,an indescribably delicate tint--the bloom of love. later, i spoke morefreely, and to each word she listened, and made answer, delightfully; sothat, already, i was in paradise.she and i; and nothing, save the silent, spacious void to see us; andonly the quiet waters of the sea of sleep to hear us.long before, the floating multitude of cloud-enfolded spheres hadvanished into nothingness. thus, we looked upon the face of theslumberous deeps, and were alone. alone, god, i would be thus alone inthe hereafter, and yet be never lonely! i had her, and, greater thanthis, she had me. aye, aeon-aged me; and on this thought, and someothers, i hope to exist through the few remaining years that may yet liebetween us._xxi_the dark sunhow long our souls lay in the arms of joy, i cannot say; but, all atonce, i was waked from my happiness, by a diminution of the pale andgentle light that lit the sea of sleep. i turned toward the huge, whiteorb, with a premonition of coming trouble. one side of it was curvinginward, as though a convex, black shadow were sweeping across it. mymemory went back. it was thus, that the darkness had come, before ourlast parting. i turned toward my love, inquiringly. with a suddenknowledge of woe, i noticed how wan and unreal she had grown, even inthat brief space. her voice seemed to come to me from a distance. thetouch of her hands was no more than the gentle pressure of a summerwind, and grew less perceptible.already, quite half of the immense globe was shrouded. a feeling ofdesperation seized me. was she about to leave me? would she have to go,as she had gone before? i questioned her, anxiously, frightenedly; andshe, nestling closer, explained, in that strange, faraway voice, that itwas imperative she should leave me, before the sun of darkness--as shetermed it--blotted out the light. at this confirmation of my fears, iwas overcome with despair; and could only look, voicelessly, across thequiet plains of the silent sea.how swiftly the darkness spread across the face of the white orb. yet,in reality, the time must have been long, beyond human comprehension.at last, only a crescent of pale fire, lit the, now dim, sea of sleep.all this while, she had held me; but, with so soft a caress, that i hadbeen scarcely conscious of it. we waited there, together, she and i;speechless, for very sorrow. in the dimming light, her face showed,shadowy--blending into the dusky mistiness that encircled us.then, when a thin, curved line of soft light was all that lit the sea,she released me--pushing me from her, tenderly. her voice sounded in myears, 'i may not stay longer, dear one.' it ended in a sob.she seemed to float away from me, and became invisible. her voice cameto me, out of the shadows, faintly; apparently from a great distance:--'a little while--' it died away, remotely. in a breath, the sea ofsleep darkened into night. far to my left, i seemed to see, for a briefinstant, a soft glow. it vanished, and, in the same moment, i becameaware that i was no longer above the still sea; but once more suspendedin infinite space, with the green sun--now eclipsed by a vast, darksphere--before me.utterly bewildered, i stared, almost unseeingly, at the ring of greenflames, leaping above the dark edge. even in the chaos of my thoughts, iwondered, dully, at their extraordinary shapes. a multitude of questionsassailed me. i thought more of her, i had so lately seen, than of thesight before me. my grief, and thoughts of the future, filled me. was idoomed to be separated from her, always? even in the old earth-days, shehad been mine, only for a little while; then she had left me, as ithought, forever. since then, i had seen her but these times, upon thesea of sleep.a feeling of fierce resentment filled me, and miserable questionings.why could i not have gone with my love? what reason to keep us apart?why had i to wait alone, while she slumbered through the years, on thestill bosom of the sea of sleep? the sea of sleep! my thoughts turned,inconsequently, out of their channel of bitterness, to fresh, desperatequestionings. where was it? where was it? i seemed to have but justparted from my love, upon its quiet surface, and it had gone, utterly.it could not be far away! and the white orb which i had seen hidden inthe shadow of the sun of darkness! my sight dwelt upon the greensun--eclipsed. what had eclipsed it? was there a vast, dead starcircling it? was the _central_ sun--as i had come to regard it--a doublestar? the thought had come, almost unbidden; yet why should it notbe so?my thoughts went back to the white orb. strange, that it should havebeen--i stopped. an idea had come, suddenly. the white orb and the greensun! were they one and the same? my imagination wandered backward, and iremembered the luminous globe to which i had been so unaccountablyattracted. it was curious that i should have forgotten it, evenmomentarily. where were the others? i reverted again to the globe i hadentered. i thought, for a time, and matters became clearer. i conceivedthat, by entering that impalpable globule, i had passed, at once, intosome further, and, until then, invisible dimension; there, the green sunwas still visible; but as a stupendous sphere of pale, whitelight--almost as though its ghost showed, and not its material part.a long time, i mused on the subject. i remembered how, on entering thesphere, i had, immediately, lost all sight of the others. for a stillfurther period, i continued to revolve the different details in my mind.in a while, my thoughts turned to other things. i came more into thepresent, and began to look about me, seeingly. for the first time, iperceived that innumerable rays, of a subtle, violet hue, pierced thestrange semi-darkness, in all directions. they radiated from the fieryrim of the green sun. they seemed to grow upon my vision, so that, in alittle, i saw that they were countless. the night was filled withthem--spreading outward from the green sun, fan-wise. i concluded that iwas enabled to see them, by reason of the sun's glory being cut off bythe eclipse. they reached right out into space, and vanished.gradually, as i looked, i became aware that fine points of intenselybrilliant light, traversed the rays. many of them seemed to travel fromthe green sun, into distance. others came out of the void, toward thesun; but one and all, each kept strictly to the ray in which ittraveled. their speed was inconceivably great; and it was only when theyneared the green sun, or as they left it, that i could see them asseparate specks of light. further from the sun, they became thin linesof vivid fire within the violet.the discovery of these rays, and the moving sparks, interested me,extraordinarily. to where did they lead, in such countless profusion? ithought of the worlds in space.... and those sparks! messengers!possibly, the idea was fantastic; but i was not conscious of its beingso. messengers! messengers from the central sun!an idea evolved itself, slowly. was the green sun the abode of somevast intelligence? the thought was bewildering. visions of the unnameablerose, vaguely. had i, indeed, come upon the dwelling-place of theeternal? for a time, i repelled the thought, dumbly. it was toostupendous. yet....huge, vague thoughts had birth within me. i felt, suddenly, terriblynaked. and an awful nearness, shook me.and heaven ...! was that an illusion?my thoughts came and went, erratically. the sea of sleep--and she!heaven.... i came back, with a bound, to the present. somewhere, out ofthe void behind me, there rushed an immense, dark body--huge and silent.it was a dead star, hurling onward to the burying place of the stars. itdrove between me and the central suns--blotting them out from my vision,and plunging me into an impenetrable night.an age, and i saw again the violet rays. a great while later--aeons itmust have been--a circular glow grew in the sky, ahead, and i saw theedge of the receding star, show darkly against it. thus, i knew that itwas nearing the central suns. presently, i saw the bright ring of thegreen sun, show plainly against the night the star had passed into theshadow of the dead sun. after that, i just waited. the strange yearswent slowly, and ever, i watched, intently.'the thing i had expected, came at last--suddenly, awfully. a vastflare of dazzling light. a streaming burst of white flame across thedark void. for an indefinite while, it soared outward--a giganticmushroom of fire. it ceased to grow. then, as time went by, it began tosink backward, slowly. i saw, now, that it came from a huge, glowingspot near the center of the dark sun. mighty flames, still soaredoutward from this. yet, spite of its size, the grave of the star was nomore than the shining of jupiter upon the face of an ocean, whencompared with the inconceivable mass of the dead sun.i may remark here, once more, that no words will ever convey to theimagination, the enormous bulk of the two central suns._xxii_the dark nebulayears melted into the past, centuries, aeons. the light of theincandescent star, sank to a furious red.it was later, that i saw the dark nebula--at first, an impalpablecloud, away to my right. it grew, steadily, to a clot of blackness inthe night. how long i watched, it is impossible to say; for time, as wecount it, was a thing of the past. it came closer, a shapelessmonstrosity of darkness--tremendous. it seemed to slip across the night,sleepily--a very hell-fog. slowly, it slid nearer, and passed into thevoid, between me and the central suns. it was as though a curtain hadbeen drawn before my vision. a strange tremor of fear took me, and afresh sense of wonder.the green twilight that had reigned for so many millions of years, hadnow given place to impenetrable gloom. motionless, i peered about me. acentury fled, and it seemed to me that i detected occasional dull glowsof red, passing me at intervals.earnestly, i gazed, and, presently, seemed to see circular masses, thatshowed muddily red, within the clouded blackness. they appeared to begrowing out of the nebulous murk. awhile, and they became plainer to myaccustomed vision. i could see them, now, with a fair amount ofdistinctness--ruddy-tinged spheres, similar, in size, to the luminousglobes that i had seen, so long previously.they floated past me, continually. gradually, a peculiar uneasinessseized me. i became aware of a growing feeling of repugnance and dread.it was directed against those passing orbs, and seemed born of intuitiveknowledge, rather than of any real cause or reason.some of the passing globes were brighter than others; and, it was fromone of these, that a face looked, suddenly. a face, human in itsoutline; but so tortured with woe, that i stared, aghast. i had notthought there was such sorrow, as i saw there. i was conscious of anadded sense of pain, on perceiving that the eyes, which glared sowildly, were sightless. a while longer, i saw it; then it had passed on,into the surrounding gloom. after this, i saw others--all wearing thatlook of hopeless sorrow; and blind.a long time went by, and i became aware that i was nearer to the orbs,than i had been. at this, i grew uneasy; though i was less in fear ofthose strange globules, than i had been, before seeing their sorrowfulinhabitants; for sympathy had tempered my fear.later, there was no doubt but that i was being carried closer to thered spheres, and, presently, i floated among them. in awhile, iperceived one bearing down upon me. i was helpless to move from itspath. in a minute, it seemed, it was upon me, and i was submerged in adeep red mist. this cleared, and i stared, confusedly, across theimmense breadth of the plain of silence. it appeared just as i had firstseen it. i was moving forward, steadily, across its surface. away ahead,shone the vast, blood-red ring [15] that lit the place. all around, wasspread the extraordinary desolation of stillness, that had so impressedme during my previous wanderings across its starkness.presently, i saw, rising up into the ruddy gloom, the distant peaks ofthe mighty amphitheatre of mountains, where, untold ages before, i hadbeen shown my first glimpse of the terrors that underlie many things;and where, vast and silent, watched by a thousand mute gods, stands thereplica of this house of mysteries--this house that i had seen swallowedup in that hell-fire, ere the earth had kissed the sun, and vanishedfor ever.though i could see the crests of the mountain-amphitheatre, yet it wasa great while before their lower portions became visible. possibly, thiswas due to the strange, ruddy haze, that seemed to cling to the surfaceof the plain. however, be this as it may, i saw them at last.in a still further space of time, i had come so close to the mountains,that they appeared to overhang me. presently, i saw the great rift, openbefore me, and i drifted into it; without volition on my part.later, i came out upon the breadth of the enormous arena. there, at anapparent distance of some five miles, stood the house, huge, monstrousand silent--lying in the very center of that stupendous amphitheatre. sofar as i could see, it had not altered in any way; but looked as thoughit were only yesterday that i had seen it. around, the grim, darkmountains frowned down upon me from their lofty silences.far to my right, away up among inaccessible peaks, loomed the enormousbulk of the great beast-god. higher, i saw the hideous form of the dreadgoddess, rising up through the red gloom, thousands of fathoms aboveme. to the left, i made out the monstrous eyeless-thing, grey andinscrutable. further off, reclining on its lofty ledge, the lividghoul-shape showed--a splash of sinister color, among the darkmountains.slowly, i moved out across the great arena--floating. as i went, i madeout the dim forms of many of the other lurking horrors that peopledthose supreme heights.gradually, i neared the house, and my thoughts flashed back across theabyss of years. i remembered the dread specter of the place. a shortwhile passed, and i saw that i was being wafted directly toward theenormous mass of that silent building.about this time, i became aware, in an indifferent sort of way, of agrowing sense of numbness, that robbed me of the fear, which i shouldotherwise have felt, on approaching that awesome pile. as it was, iviewed it, calmly--much as a man views calamity through the haze of histobacco smoke.in a little while, i had come so close to the house, as to be able todistinguish many of the details about it. the longer i looked, the morewas i confirmed in my long-ago impressions of its entire similitude tothis strange house. save in its enormous size, i could findnothing unlike.suddenly, as i stared, a great feeling of amazement filled me. i hadcome opposite to that part, where the outer door, leading into thestudy, is situated. there, lying right across the threshold, lay a greatlength of coping stone, identical--save in size and color--with thepiece i had dislodged in my fight with the pit-creatures.the time origin is arbitrary . rav huna was prolonging his lessons and teachings of the talmud , and many of his students ,
